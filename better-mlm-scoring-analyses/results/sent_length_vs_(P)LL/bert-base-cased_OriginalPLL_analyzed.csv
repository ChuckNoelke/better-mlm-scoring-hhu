3570-5694-0003,With a further advance in culture this tabu may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be a tabu or a larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily.,-146.35783910751343,146.35783910751343,59,53,1.1132075471698113,0

3570-5694-0010,The objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial.,-67.513258934021,67.513258934021,45,37,1.2162162162162162,0

3570-5695-0001,The dependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in the later development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarily performed gradually narrows the wife remains the last.,-127.10718727111816,127.10718727111816,53,47,1.127659574468085,0

5105-28240-0023,A slight diminution in the excessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alteration in the earth's orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide.,-65.6021785736084,65.6021785736084,61,52,1.1730769230769231,0

5105-28241-0004,Although only a moderate breeze was blowing the sea was rough a circumstance to be accounted for only by the diminution in the force of the earth's attraction rendering the liquid particles so buoyant that by the mere effect of oscillation they were carried to a height that was quite unprecedented.,-104.35129070281982,104.35129070281982,67,51,1.3137254901960784,1

8230-279154-0038,We are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word.,-102.37349891662598,102.37349891662598,58,55,1.0545454545454545,0
