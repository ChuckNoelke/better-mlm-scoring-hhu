1221-135766-0002,Yet these thoughts affected hester prynne less with hope than apprehension.,-91.21876525878906,14

1221-135766-0011,Beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the child to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began to snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kisses not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive.,-288.2475280761719,59

1221-135767-0000,Hester prynne went one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state for though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank he still held an honourable and influential place among the colonial magistracy.,-334.4957580566406,83
1221-135767-0001,Another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement.,-179.4617156982422,43
1221-135767-0002,At that epoch of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter public interest and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state.,-213.58346557617188,42

1221-135767-0021,Pearl accordingly ran to the bow window at the further end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery.,-193.4561004638672,45

2300-131720-0004,Owing to his insistence on low pressure direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current.,-220.81454467773438,46
2300-131720-0005,Why if we erect a station at the falls it is a great economy to get it up to the city.,-96.35496520996094,21
2300-131720-0006,There seems no good reason for believing that it will change.,-36.47813415527344,11

2300-131720-0009,For some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits and that reason was often urged against it seriously.,-108.8316421508789,24
2300-131720-0010,It could not be used for electroplating or deposition nor could it charge storage batteries all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current.,-118.20504760742188,29

2300-131720-0013,Unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly governed and regulated than those available for his dynamo and lamp edison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light.,-195.9956817626953,39
2300-131720-0014,Mister edison was a leader far ahead of the time.,-55.98329162597656,12
2300-131720-0015,He obtained the desired speed and load with a friction brake also regulator of speed but waited for an indicator to verify it.,-129.69149780273438,23
2300-131720-0016,Then again there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running and mister edison informed me that as a marine engine started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times.,-253.6920928955078,56
2300-131720-0017,Edison had installed his historic first great central station system in new york on the multiple arc system covered by his feeder and main invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a straight two wire system throughout of the tree kind.,-279.7450866699219,52
2300-131720-0018,He soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening but for the compact districts of large cities.,-147.720703125,29
2300-131720-0019,The strong position held by the edison system under the strenuous competition that was already springing up was enormously improved by the introduction of the three wire system and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting.,-169.89883422851562,42
2300-131720-0020,It was specially suited for a trial plant also in the early days when a yield of six or eight lamps to the horse power was considered subject for congratulation.,-155.923583984375,31
2300-131720-0021,The street conductors were of the overhead pole line construction and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by edison to build and equip central stations.,-144.8335723876953,31
2300-131720-0022,Meanwhile he had called upon me to make a report of the three wire system known in england as the hopkinson both doctor john hopkinson and mister edison being independent inventors at practically the same time.,-219.0364227294922,42
2300-131720-0023,I think he was perhaps more appreciative than i was of the discipline of the edison construction department and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the fourth before we started up.,-147.3431396484375,40
2300-131720-0024,But the plant ran and it was the first three wire station in this country.,-74.79853057861328,15
2300-131720-0025,They were later used as reserve machines and finally with the engine retired from service as part of the collection of edisonia but they remain in practically as good condition as when installed in eighteen eighty three.,-182.7425994873047,39
2300-131720-0026,The arc lamp installed outside a customer's premises or in a circuit for public street lighting burned so many hours nightly so many nights in the month and was paid for at that rate subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident.,-239.78176879882812,48
2300-131720-0027,Edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water and he proceeded to develop a meter.,-93.47610473632812,22
2300-131720-0028,There was infinite scepticism around him on the subject and while other inventors were also giving the subject their thought the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weighed and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use could not be brought to accurate registration.,-267.7224426269531,62
2300-131720-0029,Hence the edison electrolytic meter is no longer used despite its excellent qualities.,-84.70358276367188,16
2300-131720-0030,The principle employed in the edison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance.,-115.71566772460938,25
2300-131720-0031,Associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation freedom from inaccuracy and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage.,-193.90582275390625,37
2300-131720-0032,The standard edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the central station company for examination another set being substituted.,-158.81634521484375,29
2300-131720-0033,In december eighteen eighty eight mister w j jenks read an interesting paper before the american institute of electrical engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter then more generally in use than any other.,-224.1035919189453,48
2300-131720-0034,The others having been in operation too short a time to show definite results although they also went quickly to a dividend basis.,-115.05950927734375,23
2300-131720-0035,In this connection it should be mentioned that the association of edison illuminating companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the edison meter was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above one thousand lights and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter.,-281.22613525390625,61
2300-131720-0036,The meter continued in general service during eighteen ninety nine and probably up to the close of the century.,-96.95555877685547,19
2300-131720-0037,He weighed and reweighed the meter plates and pursued every line of investigation imaginable but all in vain.,-95.82440185546875,20
2300-131720-0038,He felt he was up against it and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better.,-62.471534729003906,19

2830-3979-0001,The condition is that i will be permitted to make luther talk american streamline him so to speak because you will never get people whether in or outside the lutheran church actually to read luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to americans.,-240.02145385742188,54
2830-3979-0002,Let us begin with that his commentary on galatians.,-53.79612731933594,11
2830-3979-0003,The undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved a most difficult one and at times became oppressive.,-104.14884185791016,22
2830-3979-0004,It was written in latin.,-22.519481658935547,6

2830-3979-0006,A word should now be said about the origin of luther's commentary on galatians.,-74.42150115966797,18
2830-3979-0007,Much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine my galatians for instance.,-221.023681640625,49
2830-3979-0008,In other words these three men took down the lectures which luther addressed to his students in the course of galatians and roerer prepared the manuscript for the printer.,-170.54490661621094,33
2830-3979-0009,It presents like no other of luther's writings the central thought of christianity the justification of the sinner for the sake of christ's merits alone.,-128.80654907226562,31
2830-3979-0010,But the essence of luther's lectures is there.,-51.55445861816406,10

2830-3980-0038,Grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ.,-63.187156677246094,19
2830-3980-0039,The terms of grace and peace are common terms with paul and are now pretty well understood.,-86.3765869140625,18

2830-3980-0046,Was it not enough to say from god the father.,-52.1088981628418,10
2830-3980-0047,To do so is to lose god altogether because god becomes intolerable when we seek to measure and to comprehend his infinite majesty.,-106.38681030273438,23

2830-3980-0050,Did not christ himself say i am the way and the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me.,-78.67391967773438,25
2830-3980-0051,When you argue about the nature of god apart from the question of justification you may be as profound as you like.,-79.33597564697266,22
2830-3980-0052,We are to hear christ who has been appointed by the father as our divine teacher.,-80.17929077148438,16
2830-3980-0053,At the same time paul confirms our creed that christ is very god.,-75.8663101196289,14
2830-3980-0054,That christ is very god is apparent in that paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the father as for instance the power to dispense grace and peace.,-149.16624450683594,32
2830-3980-0055,To bestow peace and grace lies in the province of god who alone can create these blessings the angels cannot.,-104.77947235107422,21
2830-3980-0056,Otherwise paul should have written grace from god the father and peace from our lord jesus christ.,-94.96428680419922,20
2830-3980-0057,The arians took christ for a noble and perfect creature superior even to the angels because by him god created heaven and earth.,-117.7269515991211,24

2830-3980-0059,Paul sticks to his theme.,-26.17259979248047,5
2830-3980-0060,He never loses sight of the purpose of his epistle.,-39.59444046020508,11
2830-3980-0061,Not gold or silver or paschal lambs or an angel but himself what for.,-92.5956802368164,16
2830-3980-0062,Not for a crown or a kingdom or our goodness but for our sins.,-69.21578979492188,14
2830-3980-0063,Underscore these words for they are full of comfort for sore consciences.,-72.89976501464844,16
2830-3980-0064,How may we obtain remission of our sins.,-32.75079345703125,8
2830-3980-0065,Paul answers the man who is named jesus christ and the son of god gave himself for our sins.,-92.01102447509766,21
2830-3980-0066,Since christ was given for our sins it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by our own efforts.,-85.53755950927734,21
2830-3980-0067,This sentence also defines our sins as great so great in fact that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin.,-97.81812286376953,25
2830-3980-0068,The greatness of the ransom christ the son of god indicates this.,-77.57865905761719,12
2830-3980-0069,The vicious character of sin is brought out by the words who gave himself for our sins.,-72.92970275878906,17
2830-3980-0070,But we are careless we make light of sin.,-45.34636688232422,9
2830-3980-0071,We think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin.,-72.17105865478516,13
2830-3980-0072,This passage then bears out the fact that all men are sold under sin.,-61.87520980834961,14
2830-3980-0073,This attitude springs from a false conception of sin the conception that sin is a small matter easily taken care of by good works that we must present ourselves unto god with a good conscience that we must feel no sin before we may feel that christ was given for our sins.,-215.07351684570312,52
2830-3980-0074,This attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others.,-58.8306770324707,15
2830-3980-0075,But the real significance and comfort of the words for our sins is lost upon them.,-71.25254821777344,16
2830-3980-0076,On the other hand we are not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair.,-56.02864074707031,17
2961-960-0000,He passes abruptly from persons to ideas and numbers and from ideas and numbers to persons from the heavens to man from astronomy to physiology he confuses or rather does not distinguish subject and object first and final causes and is dreaming of geometrical figures lost in a flux of sense.,-243.81265258789062,54
2961-960-0001,The influence with the timaeus has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding.,-94.57939147949219,17
2961-960-0002,In the supposed depths of this dialogue the neo platonists found hidden meanings and connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato.,-190.1072235107422,42
2961-960-0003,They were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly characteristic in him his effort to realize and connect abstractions was not understood by them at all.,-172.97808837890625,40
2961-960-0004,There is no danger of the modern commentators on the timaeus falling into the absurdities of the neo platonists.,-92.24356842041016,23
2961-960-0005,In the present day we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought.,-107.03543090820312,25
2961-960-0006,The fancies of the neo platonists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own day.,-156.32635498046875,44
2961-960-0007,But they have nothing to do with the interpretation of plato and in spirit they are opposed to him.,-73.72271728515625,20
2961-960-0008,We do not know how plato would have arranged his own dialogues or whether the thought of arranging any of them besides the two trilogies which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind.,-157.88357543945312,41
2961-960-0009,The dialogue is primarily concerned with the animal creation including under this term the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among the animals.,-120.0157470703125,25
2961-960-0010,But he has not as yet defined this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in ranking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul.,-194.96710205078125,49
2961-960-0011,With heracleitus he acknowledges the perpetual flux like anaxagoras he asserts the predominance of mind although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pythagoreans he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number.,-241.37701416015625,54
2961-960-0012,Many if not all the elements of the pre socratic philosophy are included in the timaeus.,-82.70375061035156,19
2961-960-0013,It is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life.,-95.4842758178711,28
2961-960-0014,The ideas also remain but they have become types in nature forms of men animals birds fishes.,-108.9546127319336,17
2961-960-0015,The style and plan of the timaeus differ greatly from that of any other of the platonic dialogues.,-79.03797912597656,21
2961-960-0016,But plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the phaedrus or symposium.,-92.62421417236328,22
2961-960-0017,Nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction in which he is using words after his accustomed manner.,-91.83570098876953,20
2961-960-0018,But in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up.,-92.8106918334961,23
2961-960-0019,He could write in one style but not in another and the greek language had not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena.,-117.00137329101562,30
2961-960-0020,And hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the timaeus of plato which characterizes the philosophical poem of lucretius.,-114.87991333007812,28
2961-960-0021,There is a want of flow and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apposition and more of repetition than occurs in plato's earlier writings.,-157.564208984375,38
2961-960-0022,Plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art.,-75.31358337402344,21
2961-961-0000,Socrates begins the timaeus with a summary of the republic.,-62.25421905517578,12
2961-961-0001,And now he desires to see the ideal state set in motion he would like to know how she behaved in some great struggle.,-103.93160247802734,24
2961-961-0002,And therefore to you i turn timaeus citizen of locris who are at once a philosopher and a statesman and to you critias whom all athenians know to be similarly accomplished and to hermocrates who is also fitted by nature and education to share in our discourse.,-277.3063049316406,55
2961-961-0003,I will if timaeus approves i approve.,-60.78372573852539,8

2961-961-0005,Some poems of solon were recited by the boys.,-52.53649139404297,11
2961-961-0006,And what was the subject of the poem said the person who made the remark.,-60.51689910888672,15
2961-961-0007,The subject was a very noble one he described the most famous action in which the athenian people were ever engaged.,-106.85281372070312,23
2961-961-0008,But the memory of their exploits has passed away owing to the lapse of time and the extinction of the actors.,-77.24854278564453,21

2961-961-0011,The genealogies which you have recited to us out of your own annals solon are a mere children's story.,-108.24070739746094,25
2961-961-0012,For in the times before the great flood athens was the greatest and best of cities and did the noblest deeds and had the best constitution of any under the face of heaven.,-136.2993621826172,36
2961-961-0013,Solon marvelled and desired to be informed of the particulars.,-50.88648223876953,13
2961-961-0014,Nine thousand years have elapsed since she founded yours and eight thousand since she founded ours as our annals record.,-90.311767578125,21
2961-961-0015,Many laws exist among us which are the counterpart of yours as they were in the olden time.,-73.296875,19
2961-961-0016,I will briefly describe them to you and you shall read the account of them at your leisure in the sacred registers.,-81.36907958984375,22
2961-961-0017,Observe again what care the law took in the pursuit of wisdom searching out the deep things of the world and applying them to the use of man.,-114.36853790283203,29
2961-961-0018,The most famous of them all was the overthrow of the island of atlantis.,-60.86812210083008,16
2961-961-0019,For at the peril of her own existence and when the other hellenes had deserted her she repelled the invader and of her own accord gave liberty to all the nations within the pillars.,-152.1882781982422,37
2961-961-0020,This is the explanation of the shallows which are found in that part of the atlantic ocean.,-68.64997863769531,20
2961-961-0021,But i would not speak at the time because i wanted to refresh my memory.,-54.25543212890625,15
2961-961-0022,Then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment first timaeus who is a natural philosopher will speak of the origin of the world going down to the creation of man and then i shall receive the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the lost athenian citizens of whom the egyptian record spoke.,-316.2664794921875,76
3570-5694-0000,But already at a point in economic evolution far antedating the emergence of the lady specialised consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system.,-194.19525146484375,43
3570-5694-0001,The utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth.,-80.72142028808594,18
3570-5694-0002,Such consumption as falls to the women is merely incidental to their work it is a means to their continued labour and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fulness of life.,-145.4071807861328,35
3570-5694-0003,With a further advance in culture this tabu may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be a tabu or a larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily.,-253.41064453125,56
3570-5694-0004,In the nature of things luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class.,-56.54384994506836,18
3570-5694-0005,Under the tabu certain victuals and more particularly certain beverages are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class.,-96.98330688476562,23
3570-5694-0006,Drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific as being a mark at the second remove of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence.,-185.283935546875,47
3570-5694-0007,It has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle.,-131.26368713378906,33
3570-5694-0008,The consumption of luxuries in the true sense is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself and is therefore a mark of the master.,-103.26559448242188,28
3570-5694-0009,With many qualifications with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradually weakened the general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters.,-161.10096740722656,34
3570-5694-0010,The objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial.,-165.55345153808594,40
3570-5694-0011,The custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion these motives are also present in the later development but they do not continue to be the sole motives.,-147.42227172851562,35
3570-5694-0012,There is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades.,-47.61711502075195,12
3570-5694-0013,This differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility.,-72.02030944824219,18
3570-5694-0014,Many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time lesser men of substance in their own right so that some of them are scarcely at all others only partially to be rated as vicarious consumers.,-169.95867919921875,39
3570-5694-0015,So many of them however as make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification.,-135.09365844726562,28
3570-5694-0016,Many of these again and also many of the other aristocracy of less degree have in turn attached to their persons a more or less comprehensive group of vicarious consumer in the persons of their wives and children their servants retainers et cetera.,-211.22940063476562,47
3570-5694-0017,The wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude real or ostensible.,-110.55477142333984,29
3570-5694-0018,The wearers of uniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into two classes the free and the servile or the noble and the ignoble.,-98.65961456298828,29
3570-5694-0019,But the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked.,-48.2172737121582,12
3570-5694-0020,So those offices which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and accoutrements and the like in short those which may be classed as ostensibly predatory employments.,-221.71690368652344,46
3570-5694-0021,Whenever as in these cases the menial service in question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a reflected honorific character.,-163.6622314453125,34
3570-5694-0022,The livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it.,-62.69887924194336,14
3570-5695-0000,In a general way though not wholly nor consistently these two groups coincide.,-72.96773529052734,13
3570-5695-0001,The dependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in the later development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarily performed gradually narrows the wife remains the last.,-211.23220825195312,49
3570-5695-0002,But as we descend the social scale the point is presently reached where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone.,-117.69829559326172,27
3570-5695-0003,In the communities of the western culture this point is at present found among the lower middle class.,-81.72771453857422,18
3570-5695-0004,If beauty or comfort is achieved and it is a more or less fortuitous circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves to the great economic law of wasted effort.,-164.92906188964844,38
3570-5695-0005,The man of the household also can do something in this direction and indeed he commonly does but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence along the margin of the slums the man and presently also the children virtually cease to consume valuable goods for appearances and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household's pecuniary decency.,-321.79864501953125,69
3570-5695-0006,Very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decency is put away.,-116.84861755371094,31
3570-5695-0007,There is no class and no country that has yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need.,-136.559814453125,32
3570-5695-0008,The question is which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect.,-74.97238159179688,21
3570-5695-0009,Each will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth.,-70.21119689941406,14
3570-5695-0010,The modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line.,-70.80029296875,14
3570-5695-0011,It is evident therefore that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure.,-91.412353515625,27
3570-5695-0012,It is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest.,-201.27902221679688,55
3570-5695-0013,Consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country.,-57.952205657958984,18
3570-5695-0014,Among the country population its place is to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighborhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute.,-180.20399475097656,38
3570-5695-0015,The result is a great mobility of the labor employed in printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well defined and considerable body of workmen.,-119.300537109375,27
3570-5696-0000,Under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset.,-158.31390380859375,36
3570-5696-0001,But the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme leisure held the first place at the start and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the quasi peaceable culture.,-259.19427490234375,57
3570-5696-0002,Other circumstances permitting that instinct disposes men to look with favor upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use.,-112.25699615478516,22
3570-5696-0003,A reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is effected by a resort to make believe many and intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed many organizations are founded with some specious object of amelioration embodied in their official style and title there is much coming and going and a deal of talk to the end that the talkers may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffic.,-404.39508056640625,86
3570-5696-0004,The salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated.,-58.34403610229492,13
3570-5696-0005,Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure whether of goods or of services or human life runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumer's good fame it must be an expenditure of superfluities.,-188.0386962890625,40
3570-5696-0006,As used in the speech of everyday life the word carries an undertone of deprecation.,-74.87428283691406,18
3570-5696-0007,The use of the word waste as a technical term therefore implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste.,-134.59608459472656,33
3570-5696-0008,But it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterized as wasteful.,-113.2204818725586,28
3570-5696-0009,In strict accuracy nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison.,-139.62916564941406,31
3570-5696-0010,An article may be useful and wasteful both and its utility to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions.,-122.7979736328125,27
3575-170457-0000,And often has my mother said while on her lap i laid my head she feared for time i was not made but for eternity.,-132.4119873046875,25

3575-170457-0013,The more she is engaged in her proper duties the less leisure will she have for it even as an accomplishment and a recreation.,-106.63353729248047,24

5683-32879-0010,Poor rachel her nature recoiled from deceit and she told at all events as much of the truth as she dared.,-114.82317352294922,24
5683-32879-0011,She spoke with a sudden energy which partook of fear and passion and flushed her thin cheek and made her languid eyes flash.,-105.97927856445312,25

5683-32879-0021,Dorcas in her strange way was moved.,-52.38005447387695,9

61-70970-0020,Will whispered robin opening his door as he spoke are you ready.,-80.15105438232422,13
61-70970-0021,They then renewed their journey and under the better light made a safe crossing of the stable roofs.,-89.96672821044922,18
61-70970-0022,Robin entered the hut dragging the unwilling esquire after him.,-62.46329879760742,11
61-70970-0023,Be not so foolish friend said fitzooth crossly.,-89.43961334228516,11
61-70970-0024,They moved thereafter cautiously about the hut groping before and about them to find something to show that warrenton had fulfilled his mission.,-140.71267700195312,26
61-70970-0025,They were upon the verge of an open trap in the far corner of the hut and stuteley had tripped over the edge of the reversed flap mouth of this pit.,-164.07843017578125,34
61-70970-0026,Fitzooth's hand rested at last upon the top rung of a ladder and slowly the truth came to him.,-104.65422821044922,23
61-70970-0027,Robin carefully descended the ladder and found himself soon upon firm rocky ground.,-65.28013610839844,13
61-70970-0028,Stuteley was by his side in a flash and then they both began feeling about them to ascertain the shape and character of this vault.,-115.04493713378906,27
61-70970-0029,From the blackness behind the light they heard a voice warrenton's.,-72.63824462890625,15
61-70970-0030,Save me masters but you startled me rarely.,-54.174678802490234,8
61-70970-0031,Cried he waving the lanthorn before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him.,-97.59527587890625,22
61-70970-0032,Enquired robin with his suspicions still upon him.,-61.57939147949219,11
61-70970-0033,Truly such a horse should be worth much in nottingham fair.,-83.48748779296875,14
61-70970-0034,Nay nay lording answered warrenton with a half laugh.,-84.16423034667969,14
61-70970-0035,Warrenton spoke thus with significance to show robin that he was not to think geoffrey's claims to the estate would be passed by.,-145.53729248046875,29
61-70970-0036,Robin fitzooth saw that his doubts of warrenton had been unfair and he became ashamed of himself for harboring them.,-128.1348876953125,25
61-70970-0037,His tones rang pleasantly on warrenton's ears and forthwith a good fellowship was heralded between them.,-112.43478393554688,21
61-70970-0038,The old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gamewell that this passage way led from the hut in the pleasance to sherwood and that geoffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest.,-220.5506591796875,46
61-70970-0039,He implores us to be discreet as the grave in this matter for in sooth his life is in the hollow of our hands.,-113.16403198242188,26
61-70970-0040,They regained their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gamewell.,-89.07122802734375,13
672-122797-0000,Out in the woods stood a nice little fir tree.,-44.303367614746094,10
672-122797-0001,The place he had was a very good one the sun shone on him as to fresh air there was enough of that and round him grew many large sized comrades pines as well as firs.,-175.10037231445312,38
672-122797-0002,He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air he did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries.,-139.73934936523438,38
672-122797-0003,But this was what the tree could not bear to hear.,-39.926856994628906,11
672-122797-0004,In winter when the snow lay glittering on the ground a hare would often come leaping along and jump right over the little tree.,-98.41343688964844,26
672-122797-0005,Oh that made him so angry.,-24.838775634765625,6
672-122797-0006,To grow and grow to get older and be tall thought the tree that after all is the most delightful thing in the world.,-105.83935546875,24
672-122797-0007,In autumn the wood cutters always came and felled some of the largest trees.,-64.34201049804688,16
672-122797-0008,This happened every year and the young fir tree that had now grown to a very comely size trembled at the sight for the magnificent great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking the branches were lopped off and the trees looked long and bare they were hardly to be recognised and then they were laid in carts and the horses dragged them out of the wood.,-291.6551818847656,72
672-122797-0009,Have you not met them anywhere.,-31.010955810546875,6
672-122797-0010,Rejoice in thy growth said the sunbeams.,-56.20766067504883,10
672-122797-0011,And then what happens then.,-22.777145385742188,5
672-122797-0012,I would fain know if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing.,-95.86072540283203,19
672-122797-0013,I am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh.,-99.49446105957031,18

672-122797-0019,Rejoice in thy own fresh youth.,-44.28842544555664,7
672-122797-0020,But the tree did not rejoice at all he grew and grew and was green both winter and summer.,-84.44244384765625,19
672-122797-0021,And towards christmas he was one of the first that was cut down.,-60.125694274902344,14
672-122797-0022,The axe struck deep into the very pith the tree fell to the earth with a sigh he felt a pang it was like a swoon he could not think of happiness for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home from the place where he had sprung up.,-210.3955078125,54
672-122797-0023,He well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him anymore perhaps not even the birds.,-119.18148803710938,25
672-122797-0024,The departure was not at all agreeable.,-35.01472854614258,7
672-122797-0025,The tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a court yard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we don't want the others.,-146.976806640625,33
672-122797-0026,There too were large easy chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture books and full of toys worth hundreds and hundreds of crowns at least the children said so.,-164.1501007080078,34
672-122797-0027,The servants as well as the young ladies decorated it.,-47.5438117980957,10
672-122797-0028,This evening they all said.,-31.326560974121094,5
672-122797-0029,How it will shine this evening.,-34.16521453857422,6
672-122797-0030,Perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me.,-50.131202697753906,13
672-122797-0031,It blazed up famously help help.,-62.278175354003906,7
672-122797-0032,Cried the young ladies and they quickly put out the fire.,-53.413055419921875,12
672-122797-0033,A story.,-12.190391540527344,2
672-122797-0034,A story cried the children drawing a little fat man towards the tree.,-82.29350280761719,13
672-122797-0035,But i shall tell only one story.,-35.18566131591797,7
672-122797-0036,Humpy dumpy fell downstairs and yet he married the princess.,-80.7549819946289,12
672-122797-0037,That's the way of the world.,-13.643753051757812,7
672-122797-0038,Thought the fir tree and believed it all because the man who told the story was so good looking well well.,-108.45806121826172,22
672-122797-0039,I won't tremble to morrow thought the fir tree.,-66.16820526123047,12
672-122797-0040,And the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought.,-49.642520904541016,12
672-122797-0041,In the morning the servant and the housemaid came in.,-39.44112014770508,11
672-122797-0042,But they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here in a dark corner where no daylight could enter they left him.,-99.46340942382812,29
672-122797-0043,What's the meaning of this thought the tree.,-45.86143493652344,9
672-122797-0044,And he leaned against the wall lost in reverie.,-36.785892486572266,10
672-122797-0045,Time enough had he too for his reflections for days and nights passed on and nobody came up and when at last somebody did come it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way.,-178.2977294921875,41
672-122797-0046,Tis now winter out of doors thought the tree.,-62.1312141418457,10
672-122797-0047,How kind man is after all.,-36.867103576660156,6
672-122797-0048,If it only were not so dark here and so terribly lonely.,-53.29601287841797,12

672-122797-0050,They snuffed about the fir tree and rustled among the branches.,-63.72038269042969,13
672-122797-0051,I am by no means old said the fir tree.,-51.64224624633789,10
672-122797-0052,There's many a one considerably older than i am.,-56.9661865234375,10
672-122797-0053,They were so extremely curious.,-23.360336303710938,5
672-122797-0054,I know no such place said the tree.,-44.05793762207031,8
672-122797-0055,And then he told all about his youth and the little mice had never heard the like before and they listened and said.,-105.86897277832031,23
672-122797-0056,Said the fir tree thinking over what he had himself related.,-70.22933959960938,11
672-122797-0057,Yes in reality those were happy times.,-37.254364013671875,7
672-122797-0058,Who is humpy dumpy asked the mice.,-63.91211700439453,9
672-122797-0059,Only that one answered the tree.,-34.93989944458008,6
672-122797-0060,It is a very stupid story.,-22.810638427734375,6
672-122797-0061,Don't you know one about bacon and tallow candles can't you tell any larder stories.,-109.61079406738281,20
672-122797-0062,No said the tree.,-27.320533752441406,4
672-122797-0063,Then good bye said the rats and they went home.,-52.3946647644043,10
672-122797-0064,At last the little mice stayed away also and the tree sighed after all it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me and listened to what i told them.,-150.00244140625,33
672-122797-0065,Now that too is over.,-20.144054412841797,5
672-122797-0066,Why one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft.,-75.2857666015625,16
672-122797-0067,The trunks were moved the tree was pulled out and thrown rather hard it is true down on the floor but a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone.,-163.6150665283203,33
672-122797-0068,But it was not the fir tree that they meant.,-43.43055725097656,10
672-122797-0069,It was in a corner that he lay among weeds and nettles.,-54.01427459716797,14
672-122797-0070,The golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine.,-71.22654724121094,20
672-122797-0071,In the court yard some of the merry children were playing who had danced at christmas round the fir tree and were so glad at the sight of him.,-123.63928985595703,30
672-122797-0072,And the gardener's boy chopped the tree into small pieces there was a whole heap lying there.,-78.20599365234375,19
672-122797-0073,The wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper and it sighed so deeply.,-103.07461547851562,17
672-122797-0074,However that was over now the tree gone the story at an end.,-70.11869049072266,13
6829-68769-0000,Kenneth and beth refrained from telling the other girls or uncle john of old will rogers's visit but they got mister watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check.,-223.78363037109375,43
6829-68769-0001,It was a serious crime indeed mister watson told them and tom gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in state's prison as a consequence of his rash act.,-166.608642578125,34
6829-68769-0002,I can't see it in that light said the old lawyer.,-52.47660446166992,12
6829-68769-0003,It was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved.,-59.64217758178711,14
6829-68769-0004,But they could not have proven a case against lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably mere bluff.,-109.01070404052734,27
6829-68769-0005,He was soft hearted and impetuous said beth and being in love he didn't stop to count the cost.,-106.2599868774414,24
6829-68769-0006,If the prosecution were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check then the young man would be allowed his freedom.,-102.27347564697266,25
6829-68769-0007,But under the circumstances i doubt if such an arrangement could be made.,-51.98164367675781,13

6829-68769-0017,Worse tom worse n ever replied the jailer gloomily.,-101.41058349609375,12

6829-68769-0019,Sorry we haven't any reception room in the jail.,-50.967262268066406,10
6829-68769-0020,Sit down please said gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice there's a bench here.,-83.6543197631836,16
6829-68769-0021,A fresh wholesome looking boy was tom gates with steady gray eyes an intelligent forehead but a sensitive rather weak mouth.,-142.81155395507812,22
6829-68769-0022,We have heard something of your story said kenneth and are interested in it.,-74.72818756103516,16
6829-68769-0023,I didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not i did it and i'm glad i did.,-59.513099670410156,21
6829-68769-0024,Old will is a fine fellow but poor and helpless since missus rogers had her accident.,-111.47700500488281,18
6829-68769-0025,Then rogers wouldn't do anything but lead her around and wait upon her and the place went to rack and ruin.,-107.71234130859375,23
6829-68769-0026,He spoke simply but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them.,-57.21175765991211,15
6829-68769-0027,Whose name did you sign to the check asked kenneth.,-64.5225830078125,13

6829-68769-0029,It's a stock company and rich.,-34.42510986328125,7
6829-68769-0030,I was bookkeeper so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature.,-72.17066955566406,17
6829-68769-0031,As regards my robbing the company i'll say that i saved them a heavy loss one day.,-95.97200012207031,18
6829-68769-0032,I discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant but marshall never even thanked me.,-96.51100158691406,21
6829-68769-0033,It was better for him to think the girl unfeeling than to know the truth.,-64.52977752685547,17
6829-68769-0034,I'm going to see mister marshall said kenneth and discover what i can do to assist you thank you sir.,-102.60147094726562,25

6829-68769-0038,And it ruins a man's disposition.,-33.98471450805664,7
6829-68769-0039,He looked up rather ungraciously but motioned them to be seated.,-53.540931701660156,14
6829-68769-0040,Some girl has been here twice to interview my men and i have refused to admit her.,-80.15834045410156,17

6829-68769-0050,Beth uneasy at his silence nudged him.,-56.04597473144531,9
6829-68769-0051,There was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face.,-42.02008819580078,12
6829-68769-0052,He might have had that forged check for the face of it if he'd been sharp.,-80.40351104736328,17
6829-68769-0053,And to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars.,-74.27775573730469,20
6829-68771-0000,So to the surprise of the democratic committee and all his friends mister hopkins announced that he would oppose forbes's aggressive campaign with an equal aggressiveness and spend as many dollars in doing so as might be necessary.,-204.77520751953125,43

6829-68771-0007,The description she gave of the coming reception to the woman's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mister hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were.,-243.40707397460938,53

6829-68771-0028,She even seemed mildly amused at the attention she attracted.,-40.629600524902344,10
6829-68771-0029,Beth was a beautiful girl the handsomest of the three cousins by far yet eliza surpassed her in natural charm and seemed well aware of the fact.,-148.1353759765625,31
6829-68771-0030,Her manner was neither independent nor assertive but rather one of well bred composure and calm reliance.,-78.1893081665039,18
6829-68771-0031,Her eyes wandered to the maid's hands.,-30.464859008789062,8
6829-68771-0032,However her features and form might repress any evidence of nervousness these hands told a different story.,-102.96223449707031,19
6829-68771-0033,She rose quickly to her feet with an impetuous gesture that made her visitor catch her breath.,-63.129905700683594,19

6930-75918-0002,Congratulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere during her journey.,-63.36103057861328,11
6930-75918-0003,From the respect paid her on all sides she seemed like a queen and from the adoration with which she was treated by two or three she appeared an object of worship the queen mother gave the french the most affectionate reception france was her native country and she had suffered too much unhappiness in england for england to have made her forget france.,-272.8912048339844,71
6930-75918-0004,She taught her daughter then by her own affection for it that love for a country where they had both been hospitably received and where a brilliant future opened before them.,-137.01124572753906,32

6930-75918-0011,I am convinced of what i say said the count.,-54.28427505493164,10
6930-75918-0012,It is annoyance then.,-28.66350555419922,4
6930-75918-0013,In those very terms i even added more.,-56.12628936767578,8
6930-75918-0014,But continued raoul not interrupted by this movement of his friend heaven be praised the french who are pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet reckless even are capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to bear on matters of such high importance.,-230.3875732421875,46

6930-75918-0017,But in this friendly pressure raoul could detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict.,-99.10342407226562,17

6930-76324-0006,Hers happened to be in the same frame too but she evidently didn't care about that.,-73.0896987915039,18
6930-76324-0007,Now what have you to say cynthia sprague.,-61.31365203857422,10
6930-76324-0008,I thought we were stumped again when i first saw that picture but it's been of some use after all.,-85.97702026367188,22
6930-76324-0009,Do you suppose the miniature was a copy of the same thing.,-51.110225677490234,12
6930-76324-0010,What in the world is that queried joyce.,-57.14208221435547,10
6930-76324-0011,They worry me terribly and besides i'd like to see what this lovely furniture looks like without such quantities of dust all over it good scheme cyn.,-161.6671600341797,28
6930-76324-0012,We'll come in here this afternoon with old clothes on and have a regular house cleaning.,-73.45457458496094,17
6930-76324-0013,It can't hurt anything i'm sure for we won't disturb things at all.,-74.94991302490234,16
6930-76324-0014,This thought however did not enter the heads of the enthusiastic pair.,-52.44092559814453,12
6930-76324-0015,Smuggling the house cleaning paraphernalia into the cellar window unobserved that afternoon proved no easy task for cynthia had added a whisk broom and dust pan to the outfit.,-171.48611450195312,35
6930-76324-0016,The lure proved too much for him and he came sporting after it as friskily as a young kitten much to cynthia's delight when she caught sight of him.,-146.36546325683594,33
6930-76324-0017,Oh let him come along she urged i do love to see him about that old house.,-95.07896423339844,17
6930-76324-0018,He makes it sort of cozier.,-31.92079734802246,8
6930-76324-0019,Now let's dust the furniture and pictures.,-44.45023727416992,8
6930-76324-0020,Yet little as it was it had already made a vast difference in the aspect of the room.,-71.98284912109375,18
6930-76324-0021,Surface dust at least had been removed and the fine old furniture gave a hint of its real elegance and polish.,-113.8655014038086,22
6930-76324-0022,Then she suddenly remarked.,-24.178131103515625,4
6930-76324-0023,And my pocket money is getting low again and you haven't any left as usual.,-77.66203308105469,16
6930-76324-0024,They say illumination by candle light is the prettiest in the world.,-49.456233978271484,13
6930-76324-0025,Why it's goliath as usual they both cried peering in.,-84.8593521118164,13
6930-76324-0026,Isn't he the greatest for getting into odd corners.,-49.72205352783203,10
6930-76324-0027,Forgetting all their weariness they seized their candles and scurried through the house finding an occasional paper tucked away in some odd corner.,-126.77517700195312,27
6930-76324-0028,Well i'm convinced that the boarded up house mystery happened not earlier than april sixteenth eighteen sixty one and probably not much later.,-137.33932495117188,26
6930-81414-0000,No words were spoken no language was uttered save that of wailing and hissing and that somehow was indistinct as if it existed in fancy and not in reality.,-127.54104614257812,32
6930-81414-0001,I heard a noise behind i turned and saw kaffar his black eyes shining while in his hand he held a gleaming knife he lifted it above his head as if to strike but i had the strength of ten men and i hurled him from me.,-182.04237365722656,50
6930-81414-0002,Onward said a distant voice.,-41.467979431152344,6
6930-81414-0003,No sound broke the stillness of the night.,-28.780445098876953,9
6930-81414-0004,The story of its evil influence came back to me and in my bewildered condition i wondered whether there was not some truth in what had been said.,-111.3998031616211,29
6930-81414-0005,What was that.,-13.428153991699219,3
6930-81414-0006,What then a human hand large and shapely appeared distinctly on the surface of the pond.,-95.73831939697266,17
6930-81414-0007,Nothing more not even the wrist to which it might be attached.,-55.59294128417969,12
6930-81414-0008,It did not beckon or indeed move at all it was as still as the hand of death.,-75.24707794189453,19
6930-81414-0009,I awoke to consciousness fighting at first it seemed as if i was fighting with a phantom but gradually my opponent became more real to me it was kaffar.,-140.25924682617188,31
6930-81414-0010,A sound of voices a flash of light.,-35.67523193359375,8
6930-81414-0011,A feeling of freedom and i was awake where.,-55.657928466796875,9
6930-81414-0012,Said another voice which i recognized as voltaire's kaffar.,-83.46780395507812,13
6930-81414-0013,I had scarcely known what i had been saying or doing up to this time but as he spoke i looked at my hand.,-93.85354614257812,24
6930-81414-0014,In the light of the moon i saw a knife red with blood and my hand too was also discoloured.,-94.63973999023438,22
6930-81414-0015,I do not know i am dazed bewildered.,-46.3858757019043,10
6930-81414-0016,But that is kaffar's knife.,-44.613624572753906,8
6930-81414-0017,I know he had it this very evening.,-36.529052734375,8
6930-81414-0018,I remember saying have we been together.,-39.76401138305664,7
6930-81414-0019,Voltaire picked up something from the ground and looked at it.,-49.194480895996094,13
6930-81414-0020,I say you do know what this means and you must tell us.,-44.20539474487305,13
6930-81414-0021,A terrible thought flashed into my mind.,-24.834997177124023,7
6930-81414-0022,I had again been acting under the influence of this man's power.,-49.676612854003906,13
6930-81414-0023,Perchance too kaffar's death might serve him in good stead.,-77.7191162109375,14
6930-81414-0024,My tongue refused to articulate my power of speech left me.,-62.414920806884766,11
6930-81414-0025,My position was too terrible.,-26.81650161743164,5
6930-81414-0026,My overwrought nerves yielded at last.,-46.1828498840332,7
6930-81414-0027,For some time after that i remembered nothing distinctly.,-52.69420623779297,9
7021-79730-0000,The three modes of management.,-29.699913024902344,5
7021-79730-0001,To suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a substitution as that is entirely to mistake its nature and design.,-109.50135803222656,27
7021-79730-0002,By reason and affection.,-24.322219848632812,4
7021-79730-0003,As the chaise drives away mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the door step her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor distrust and suspicion of her mother disappointment vexation and ill humor surge and swell among those delicate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend doing perhaps an irreparable injury.,-343.697265625,68
7021-79730-0004,The mother as soon as the chaise is so far turned that mary can no longer watch the expression of her countenance goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satisfaction upon her face at the ingenuity and success of her little artifice.,-205.06353759765625,52
7021-79730-0005,So you will be a good girl i know and not make any trouble but will stay at home contentedly won't you.,-102.98069763183594,24
7021-79730-0006,The mother in managing the case in this way relies partly on convincing the reason of the child and partly on an appeal to her affection.,-116.68032836914062,26
7021-79730-0007,If you should not be a good girl but should show signs of making us any trouble i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone.,-146.197998046875,36
7021-79730-0008,But this last supposition is almost always unnecessary for if mary has been habitually managed on this principle she will not make any trouble.,-124.65159606933594,27
7021-79730-0009,It is indeed true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the young and of cultivating their reason and securing their affection can not be overrated.,-117.2650146484375,31
7021-79740-0000,To such persons these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their will or rather of yielding to their influence are specially useful.,-129.53634643554688,27
7021-79740-0001,Della had a young sister named maria and a cousin whose name was jane.,-69.35395812988281,17
7021-79740-0002,Now delia contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls.,-94.63926696777344,24
7021-79740-0003,To give an idea of these conversations i will report one of them in full.,-61.29927062988281,15
7021-79740-0004,You have come andella andella was the name of jane's doll to make rosalie a visit.,-121.13877868652344,22
7021-79740-0005,I am very glad.,-14.965206146240234,4
7021-79740-0006,I expect you have been a very good girl andella since you were here last.,-74.77117156982422,16
7021-79740-0007,Then turning to jane she asked in a somewhat altered tone has she been a good girl jane.,-88.30317687988281,20
7021-79740-0008,For instance one day the children had been playing upon the piazza with blocks and other playthings and finally had gone into the house leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza instead of putting them away in their places as they ought to have done.,-165.5984649658203,53
7021-79740-0009,They were now playing with their dolls in the parlor.,-40.87113571166992,11
7021-79740-0010,Delia came to the parlor and with an air of great mystery beckoned the children aside and said to them in a whisper leave andella and rosalie here and don't say a word to them.,-177.38172912597656,42
7021-79740-0011,So saying she led the way on tiptoe followed by the children out of the room and round by a circuitous route to the piazza there.,-132.77621459960938,31
7021-79740-0012,Said she pointing to the playthings see.,-55.98015594482422,8
7021-79740-0013,Put these playthings all away quick and carefully and we will not let them know any thing about your leaving them out.,-109.951416015625,23
7021-79740-0014,And this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been.,-168.3603515625,40
7021-79759-0000,Nature of the effect produced by early impressions.,-39.82341384887695,8
7021-79759-0001,That is comparatively nothing.,-24.10065460205078,4
7021-79759-0002,They are chiefly formed from combinations of the impressions made in childhood.,-53.804931640625,12
7021-79759-0003,Vast importance and influence of this mental furnishing.,-52.350337982177734,10
7021-79759-0004,Without going to any such extreme as this we can easily see on reflection how vast an influence on the ideas and conceptions as well as on the principles of action in mature years must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impresses upon the mind.,-215.84628295898438,57
7021-79759-0005,The pain produced by an act of hasty and angry violence to which a father subjects his son may soon pass away but the memory of it does not pass away with the pain.,-126.60993957519531,35
7021-85628-0000,But anders cared nothing about that.,-35.5164680480957,7
7021-85628-0001,He made a bow so deep that his back came near breaking and he was dumbfounded i can tell you when he saw it was nobody but anders.,-132.62025451660156,30
7021-85628-0002,He was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jack knife.,-55.2843132019043,16
7021-85628-0003,Now this knife was a splendid one though half the blade was gone and the handle was a little cracked and anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jack knife.,-163.1152801513672,38
7021-85628-0004,Yes why not thought anders.,-46.55166244506836,6
7021-85628-0005,Seeing that i am so fine i may as well go and visit the king.,-61.35908889770508,15
7021-85628-0006,I am going to the court ball answered anders.,-64.21958923339844,10
7021-85628-0007,And she took anders hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs where soldiers were posted at every third step and through the magnificent halls where courtiers in silk and velvet stood bowing wherever he went.,-175.38771057128906,41
7021-85628-0008,For like as not they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap.,-80.47054290771484,17
7021-85628-0009,At the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows.,-76.37446594238281,21
7021-85628-0010,On huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters.,-106.04226684570312,24
7021-85628-0011,The princess sat down under a blue canopy with bouquets of roses and she let anders sit in a golden chair by her side.,-111.55781555175781,27
7021-85628-0012,But you must not eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to take it off.,-72.71793365478516,20
7021-85628-0013,The princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition.,-132.23228454589844,32
7021-85628-0014,He only shook his head.,-18.193485260009766,5
7021-85628-0015,Well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed him.,-111.29437255859375,29
7021-85628-0016,That is a very fine cap you have he said.,-45.004981994628906,10
7021-85628-0017,So it is said anders.,-37.316261291503906,6
7021-85628-0018,And it is made of mother's best yarn and she knitted it herself and everybody wants to get it away from me.,-93.06185913085938,24
7021-85628-0019,With one jump anders got out of his chair.,-53.51787567138672,10
7021-85628-0020,He darted like an arrow through all the halls down all the stairs and across the yard.,-71.02444458007812,18
7021-85628-0021,He still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage.,-58.17753219604492,17
7021-85628-0022,And all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open.,-46.30327606201172,14
7021-85628-0023,But when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a king's golden crown he said that anders was a stupid.,-125.28050994873047,28
7021-85628-0024,Anders face grew red.,-44.53116989135742,5
7021-85628-0025,But his mother hugged him close.,-26.870441436767578,6
7021-85628-0026,No my little son she said.,-35.33198547363281,6
7021-85628-0027,If you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap.,-85.91109466552734,23
7127-75946-0000,At the conclusion of the banquet which was served at five o'clock the king entered his cabinet where his tailors were awaiting him for the purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing spring which was the result of so much imagination and had cost so many efforts of thought to the designers and ornament workers of the court.,-236.74240112304688,62
7127-75946-0001,Ah very well.,-15.552047729492188,3
7127-75946-0002,Let him come in then said the king and as if colbert had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself au courant with the conversation he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two courtiers.,-178.43247985839844,47
7127-75946-0003,Gentlemen to your posts whereupon saint aignan and villeroy took their leave.,-114.53174591064453,19

7127-75946-0005,What do you mean inquired louis.,-43.960044860839844,7
7127-75946-0006,He has given them with too much grace not to have others still to give if they are required which is the case at the present moment.,-111.01356506347656,27
7127-75946-0007,It is necessary therefore that he should comply the king frowned.,-62.569549560546875,11
7127-75946-0008,Does your majesty then no longer believe the disloyal attempt.,-66.33722686767578,11
7127-75946-0009,Not at all you are on the contrary most agreeable to me.,-50.368621826171875,12
7127-75946-0010,Your majesty's plan then in this affair is.,-59.166893005371094,9
7127-75946-0011,You will take them from my private treasure.,-38.945518493652344,8
7127-75946-0012,The news circulated with the rapidity of lightning during its progress it kindled every variety of coquetry desire and wild ambition.,-123.21765899658203,25
7127-75946-0013,The king had completed his toilette by nine o'clock he appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers.,-98.31321716308594,25
7127-75946-0014,The queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dias or platform erected upon the borders of the lake in a theater of wonderful elegance of construction.,-123.52397918701172,28
7127-75946-0015,Suddenly for the purpose of restoring peace and order spring accompanied by his whole court made his appearance.,-94.9835433959961,18
7127-75946-0016,The seasons allies of spring followed him closely to form a quadrille which after many words of more or less flattering import was the commencement of the dance.,-159.59591674804688,30
7127-75946-0017,His legs the best shaped at court were displayed to great advantage in flesh colored silken hose of silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself.,-155.29714965820312,32
7127-75946-0018,There was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seem to soar along.,-113.36951446533203,27
7127-75946-0019,Yes it is suppressed.,-24.74734878540039,4
7127-75946-0020,Far from it sire your majesty having given no directions about it the musicians have retained it.,-104.76016998291016,18
7127-75946-0021,Yes sire and ready dressed for the ballet.,-59.048973083496094,9
7127-75946-0022,Sire he said your majesty's most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasion with similar zeal that he has already shown on the field of battle.,-135.30514526367188,31
7127-75946-0023,The king seemed only pleased with every one present.,-49.4380989074707,9
7127-75946-0024,Monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter.,-45.30891799926758,16
7127-75946-0025,The ballet began the effect was more than beautiful.,-56.65727615356445,9
7127-75946-0026,When the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers when the simple untutored pantomime of that period only the more natural on account of the very indifferent acting of the august actors had reached its culminating point of triumph the theater shook with tumultuous applause.,-268.55712890625,54
7127-75946-0027,Disdainful of a success of which madame showed no acknowledgement he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the marked preference of the princess.,-144.73843383789062,27
7127-75946-0028,By degrees all his happiness all his brilliancy subsided into regret and uneasiness so that his limbs lost their power his arms hung heavily by his sides and his head drooped as though he was stupefied.,-170.03321838378906,45
7127-75946-0029,The king who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadrille cast a look upon his vanquished rival.,-111.17195892333984,25
7127-75947-0000,Every one could observe his agitation and prostration a prostration which was indeed the more remarkable since people were not accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side his head bewildered and his eyes with all their bright intelligence bedimmed.,-207.72117614746094,50
7127-75947-0001,Upon this madame deigned to turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte observing.,-98.6572494506836,18
7127-75947-0002,Do you think so she replied with indifference.,-32.895484924316406,8
7127-75947-0003,Yes the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own.,-80.1164321899414,16
7127-75947-0004,Explain yourself.,-14.256820678710938,3
7127-75947-0005,I allude to the goddess.,-28.73249053955078,6
7127-75947-0006,The princess inquired no.,-35.50016784667969,4
7127-75947-0007,She then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance.,-76.25054168701172,14
7127-75947-0008,The arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally.,-41.70765686035156,10
7127-75947-0009,A quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theater but it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back or perhaps for love is thus strangely constituted he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated from the presence of one who had broken his heart.,-273.1087646484375,64
7127-75947-0010,When she perceived the young man she rose like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself.,-110.196044921875,27
7127-75947-0011,Remain i implore you the evening is most lovely.,-63.41571044921875,11
7127-75947-0012,Indeed ah.,-22.008506774902344,2
7127-75947-0013,I remember now and i congratulate myself do you love any one.,-74.7601318359375,12
7127-75947-0014,Forgive me i hardly know what i am saying a thousand times forgive me madame was right quite right this brutal exile has completely turned my brain.,-147.18748474121094,29
7127-75947-0015,There cannot be a doubt he received you kindly for in fact you returned without his permission.,-83.51158142089844,17
7127-75947-0016,Oh mademoiselle why have i not a devoted sister or a true friend such as yourself.,-81.10057830810547,19
7127-75947-0017,What already here they said to her.,-39.64049530029297,7
7127-75947-0018,I have been here this quarter of an hour replied la valliere.,-73.54936218261719,14
7127-75947-0019,Did not the dancing amuse you no.,-46.7747917175293,7
7127-75947-0020,No more than the dancing.,-27.59308624267578,5
7127-75947-0021,La valliere is quite a poetess said tonnay charente.,-94.52621459960938,16
7127-75947-0022,I am a woman and there are few like me whoever loves me flatters me whoever flatters me pleases me and whoever pleases well said montalais you do not finish.,-174.375244140625,36
7127-75947-0023,It is too difficult replied mademoiselle de tonnay charente laughing loudly.,-99.8022689819336,18
7127-75947-0024,Look yonder do you not see the moon slowly rising silvering the topmost branches of the chestnuts and the oaks.,-114.53152465820312,25
7127-75947-0025,Exquisite soft turf of the woods the happiness which your friendship confers upon me.,-86.5247802734375,17
7127-75947-0026,Well said mademoiselle de tonnay charente i also think a good deal but i take care.,-118.87732696533203,23
7127-75947-0027,To say nothing said montalais so that when mademoiselle de tonnay charente thinks athenais is the only one who knows it.,-159.80307006835938,32
7127-75947-0028,Quick quick then among the high reed grass said montalais stoop athenais you are so tall.,-147.58694458007812,22
7127-75947-0029,The young girls had indeed made themselves small indeed invisible.,-59.50116729736328,10
7127-75947-0030,She was here just now said the count.,-42.6875,8
7127-75947-0031,You are positive then.,-23.77330780029297,4
7127-75947-0032,Yes but perhaps i frightened her in what way.,-58.49851608276367,9
7127-75947-0033,How is it la valliere said mademoiselle de tonnay charente that the vicomte de bragelonne spoke of you as louise.,-171.23631286621094,35
7127-75947-0034,It seems the king will not consent to it.,-37.666114807128906,9
7127-75947-0035,Good gracious has the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind.,-59.55237579345703,14
7127-75947-0036,I give my consent.,-18.077301025390625,4
7127-75947-0037,Oh i am speaking seriously replied montalais and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the king's i suppose is it not louise.,-157.755126953125,30
7127-75947-0038,Let us run then said all three and gracefully lifting up the long skirts of their silk dresses they lightly ran across the open space between the lake and the thickest covert of the park.,-167.2385711669922,37
7127-75947-0039,In fact the sound of madame's and the queen's carriages could be heard in the distance upon the hard dry ground of the roads followed by the mounted cavaliers.,-126.79523468017578,34
7127-75947-0040,In this way the fete of the whole court was a fete also for the mysterious inhabitants of the forest for certainly the deer in the brake the pheasant on the branch the fox in its hole were all listening.,-200.89224243164062,44
7176-88083-0000,All about him was a tumult of bright and broken color scattered in broad splashes.,-80.7058334350586,16
7176-88083-0001,The merganser had a crested head of iridescent green black a broad collar of lustrous white black back black and white wings white belly sides finely pencilled in black and white and a breast of rich chestnut red streaked with black.,-223.3422393798828,51
7176-88083-0002,His feet were red his long narrow beak with its saw toothed edges and sharp hooked tip was bright red.,-101.37761688232422,23
7176-88083-0003,But here he was at a terrible disadvantage as compared with the owls hawks and eagles he had no rending claws.,-110.90253448486328,25
7176-88083-0004,But suddenly straight and swift as a diving cormorant he shot down into the torrent and disappeared beneath the surface.,-94.95504760742188,23
7176-88083-0005,Once fairly a wing however he wheeled and made back hurriedly for his perch.,-97.27889251708984,17
7176-88083-0006,It might have seemed that a trout of this size was a fairly substantial meal.,-63.26789474487305,15
7176-88083-0007,But such was his keenness that even while the wide flukes of his engorged victim were still sticking out at the corners of his beak his fierce red eyes were once more peering downward into the torrent in search of fresh prey.,-188.64590454101562,48
7176-88083-0008,In despair he hurled himself downward too soon.,-48.81040573120117,8
7176-88083-0009,The great hawk followed hurriedly to retrieve his prey from the ground.,-60.03929138183594,13
7176-88083-0010,The cat growled softly picked up the prize in her jaws and trotted into the bushes to devour it.,-87.38223266601562,22
7176-88083-0011,In fact he had just finished it the last of the trout's tail had just vanished with a spasm down his strained gullet when the baffled hawk caught sight of him and swooped.,-160.64755249023438,37
7176-88083-0012,The hawk alighted on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as if surprised.,-68.55001068115234,17
7176-88083-0013,Like his unfortunate little cousin the teal he too had felt the fear of death smitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank deep fringed with weeds where the dreadful eye of the hawk should not discern him.,-235.81883239746094,51
7176-88083-0014,The hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface.,-62.96453094482422,14
7176-88083-0015,Almost instantly he was forced to the top.,-37.2900276184082,8
7176-88083-0016,Straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him.,-59.88310623168945,16
7176-88083-0017,But at this point in the rapids it was impossible for him to stay down.,-55.067161560058594,16
7176-88083-0018,But this frequenter of the heights of air for all his savage valor was troubled at the leaping waves and the tossing foam of these mad rapids he did not understand them.,-169.4671630859375,35
7176-88083-0019,As he flew his down reaching clutching talons were not half a yard above the fugitive's head.,-104.57237243652344,19
7176-88083-0020,Where the waves for an instant sank they came closer but not quite within grasping reach.,-81.04295349121094,16
7176-88083-0021,But as before the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer and he was able to flap his way onward in a cloud of foam while doom hung low above his head yet hesitated to strike.,-185.2049102783203,42
7176-88083-0022,The hawk embittered by the loss of his first quarry had become as dogged in pursuit as a weasel not to be shaken off or evaded or deceived.,-138.97523498535156,32
7176-88083-0023,He had a lot of line out and the place was none too free for a long cast but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was feeding.,-163.84352111816406,36
7176-88083-0024,The last drop fly as luck would have it caught just in the corner of the hawk's angrily open beak hooking itself firmly.,-133.60882568359375,26
7176-88083-0025,At the sudden sharp sting of it the great bird turned his head and noticed for the first time the fisherman standing on the bank.,-91.06709289550781,25
7176-88083-0026,The drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him and appalling.,-95.87088775634766,19
7176-88083-0027,Then the leader parted from the line.,-32.56098556518555,7
7176-92135-0000,He is a welcome figure at the garden parties of the elect who are always ready to encourage him by accepting free seats for his play actor managers nod to him editors allow him to contribute without charge to a symposium on the price of golf balls.,-242.89105224609375,48
7176-92135-0001,In short he becomes a prominent figure in london society and if he is not careful somebody will say so.,-91.30769348144531,21
7176-92135-0002,But even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments.,-45.542640686035156,10
7176-92135-0003,Your play must be not merely a good play but a successful one.,-50.8914794921875,13
7176-92135-0004,Frankly i cannot always say.,-33.28265380859375,6
7176-92135-0005,But suppose you said i'm fond of writing my people always say my letters home are good enough for punch.,-121.90190124511719,21
7176-92135-0006,I've got a little idea for a play about a man and a woman and another woman and but perhaps i'd better keep the plot a secret for the moment.,-106.61122131347656,32
7176-92135-0007,Anyhow it's jolly exciting and i can do the dialogue all right.,-74.74068450927734,15
7176-92135-0008,Lend me your ear for ten minutes and you shall learn just what stagecraft is.,-68.07864379882812,17
7176-92135-0009,And i should begin with a short homily on soliloquy.,-52.185089111328125,14
7176-92135-0010,Ham to be or not to be.,-24.663070678710938,7
7176-92135-0011,Now the object of this soliloquy is plain.,-38.20673751831055,11
7176-92135-0012,Indeed irresolution being the keynote of hamlet's soliloquy a clever player could to some extent indicate the whole thirty lines by a silent working of the jaw but at the same time it would be idle to deny that he would miss the finer shades of the dramatist's meaning.,-256.47320556640625,58
7176-92135-0013,We moderns however see the absurdity of it.,-46.88450622558594,9
7176-92135-0014,If it be granted first that the thoughts of a certain character should be known to the audience and secondly that soliloquy or the habit of thinking aloud is in opposition to modern stage technique how shall a soliloquy be avoided without damage to the play.,-214.27099609375,52
7176-92135-0015,And so on till you get to the end when ophelia might say ah yes or something non committal of that sort.,-108.794189453125,25
7176-92135-0016,This would be an easy way of doing it but it would not be the best way for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself.,-80.36027526855469,30
7176-92135-0017,In the old badly made play it was frequently necessary for one of the characters to take the audience into his confidence.,-91.10203552246094,22

8230-279154-0012,Familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees.,-46.391319274902344,9
8230-279154-0013,In an image of a well known face for example some parts may feel more familiar than others when this happens we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts.,-148.97039794921875,39
8230-279154-0014,I come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past.,-83.4698486328125,22
8230-279154-0015,They must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past.,-75.43589782714844,21
8230-279154-0016,In actual fact there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event.,-110.04474639892578,27
8230-279154-0017,There may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of pastness especially where immediate memory is concerned.,-88.6637954711914,21
8230-279154-0018,There is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events.,-82.17107391357422,27
8230-279154-0019,It would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events.,-179.89776611328125,44
8230-279154-0020,If we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple.,-90.1451644897461,20
8230-279154-0021,Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered.,-84.07427978515625,18
8230-279154-0022,Some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at.,-77.76551818847656,17
8230-279154-0023,In this case as in most others what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague.,-67.45555877685547,18
8230-279154-0024,The first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past.,-75.15049743652344,18
8230-279154-0025,We might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy.,-242.70330810546875,58
8230-279154-0026,This distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory.,-89.72937774658203,27
8230-279154-0027,A gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidents of its past and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe.,-156.08740234375,33
8230-279154-0028,I can set to work now to remember things i never remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning and it can hardly be wholly habit that enables me to do this.,-149.79324340820312,37
8230-279154-0029,The fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it.,-82.12437438964844,27
8230-279154-0030,Semon's two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely.,-105.7235107421875,18
8230-279154-0031,They give laws according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences which is what constitutes knowledge memory.,-149.42303466796875,33
8230-279154-0032,It is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge.,-41.61781692504883,11
8230-279154-0033,It is by no means always reliable almost everybody has at some time experienced the well known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time.,-117.54013061523438,29
8230-279154-0034,Whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object which leads us to the judgment this is familiar.,-138.78427124023438,37
8230-279154-0035,Thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone.,-60.434898376464844,17
8230-279154-0036,A further stage is recognition.,-32.3857421875,5
8230-279154-0037,Recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment.,-202.45118713378906,55
8230-279154-0038,We are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word.,-204.73309326171875,55
8230-279154-0039,This knowledge is memory in one sense though in another it is not.,-55.42024612426758,13
8230-279154-0040,There are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before.,-167.11947631835938,40
8230-279154-0041,The definition of my experience is difficult broadly speaking it is everything that is connected with what i am experiencing now by certain links of which the various forms of memory are among the most important.,-158.33888244628906,36
8230-279154-0042,Thus if i recognize a thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world.,-167.83908081054688,46
8230-279154-0043,Of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition.,-240.3169403076172,55
8455-210777-0000,I remained there alone for many hours but i must acknowledge that before i left the chambers i had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light.,-118.96643829345703,30
8455-210777-0001,Had eva crasweller not been good looking had jack been still at college had sir kennington oval remained in england had mister bunnit and the bar keeper not succeeded in stopping my carriage on the hill should i have succeeded in arranging for the final departure of my old friend.,-318.563232421875,60
8455-210777-0002,On arriving at home at my own residence i found that our salon was filled with a brilliant company.,-97.27914428710938,19
8455-210777-0003,As i spoke i made him a gracious bow and i think i showed him by my mode of address that i did not bear any grudge as to my individual self.,-140.33392333984375,33
8455-210777-0004,I have come to your shores mister president with the purpose of seeing how things are progressing in this distant quarter of the world.,-89.44119262695312,25
8455-210777-0005,We have our little struggles here as elsewhere and all things cannot be done by rose water.,-86.67367553710938,17
8455-210777-0006,We are quite satisfied now captain battleax said my wife.,-79.945556640625,11
8455-210777-0007,Quite satisfied said eva.,-35.544925689697266,5
8455-210777-0008,The ladies in compliance with that softness of heart which is their characteristic are on one side and the men by whom the world has to be managed are on the other.,-128.92820739746094,33
8455-210777-0009,No doubt in process of time the ladies will follow.,-46.552490234375,10
8455-210777-0010,Their masters said missus neverbend.,-58.931488037109375,8
8455-210777-0011,I did not mean said captain battleax to touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this.,-105.454345703125,19
8455-210777-0012,Missus neverbend you must indeed be proud of your son.,-68.0709457397461,13
8455-210777-0013,Jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to eva and was now reduced to silence by his praises.,-92.97025299072266,24
8455-210777-0014,Sir kennington oval is a very fine player said my wife.,-86.94969177246094,13
8455-210777-0015,I and my wife and son and the two craswellers and three or four others agreed to dine on board the ship on the next.,-122.90604400634766,29
8455-210777-0016,This i felt was paid to me as being president of the republic and i endeavoured to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might befit the occasion but i could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life.,-193.0461883544922,50
8455-210777-0017,My wife on the spur of the moment managed to give the gentlemen a very good dinner.,-65.35092163085938,17
8455-210777-0018,This she said was true hospitality and i am not sure that i did not agree with her.,-78.20594787597656,18
8455-210777-0019,Then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies.,-86.97549438476562,28
8455-210777-0020,Oh yes said jack and i'm nowhere.,-60.95855712890625,8
8455-210777-0021,But i mean to have my innings before long.,-57.084693908691406,9
8455-210777-0022,Of what missus neverbend had gone through in providing birds beasts and fishes not to talk of tarts and jellies for the dinner of that day no one but myself can have any idea but it must be admitted that she accomplished her task with thorough success.,-253.21231079101562,53
8455-210777-0023,We sat with the officers some little time after dinner and then went ashore.,-65.43353271484375,14
8455-210777-0024,How much of evil of real accomplished evil had there not occurred to me during the last few days.,-89.37734985351562,19
8455-210777-0025,What could i do now but just lay myself down and die.,-48.459877014160156,12
8455-210777-0026,And the death of which i dreamt could not alas.,-62.66618347167969,11
8455-210777-0027,When this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to england i would retire to a small farm which i possessed at the farthest side of the island and there in seclusion would i end my days.,-165.27182006835938,42
8455-210777-0028,Jack would become eva's happy husband and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world.,-109.17039489746094,19
8455-210777-0029,Thinking of all this i went to sleep.,-36.41677474975586,9
8455-210777-0030,Mister neverbend began the captain and i observed that up to that moment he had generally addressed me as president it cannot be denied that we have come here on an unpleasant mission.,-184.7788543701172,36
8455-210777-0031,You have received us with all that courtesy and hospitality for which your character in england stands so high.,-94.70841979980469,20
8455-210777-0032,It is a duty said i.,-36.05116271972656,6
8455-210777-0033,But your power is so superior to any that i can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it.,-110.54635620117188,27
8455-210777-0034,Not a doubt but had your force been only double or treble our own i should have found it my duty to struggle with you.,-119.63826751708984,26
8455-210777-0035,That is all quite true mister neverbend said sir ferdinando brown.,-109.4636001586914,16
8455-210777-0036,I can afford to smile because i am absolutely powerless before you but i do not the less feel that in a matter in which the progress of the world is concerned i or rather we have been put down by brute force.,-181.4425048828125,43
8455-210777-0037,You have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction.,-41.4993896484375,10
8455-210777-0038,Therefore i feel myself quite able as president of this republic to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally.,-121.70136260986328,25
8455-210777-0039,I can assure you he has not even allowed me to see the trigger since i have been on board.,-76.9314956665039,20
8455-210777-0040,Then said sir ferdinando there is nothing for it but that he must take you with him.,-79.7375259399414,19
8455-210777-0041,There came upon me a sudden shock when i heard these words which exceeded anything which i had yet felt.,-82.54084777832031,20
8455-210777-0042,You hear what sir ferdinando brown has said replied captain battleax.,-105.02262115478516,14
8455-210777-0043,But what is the delicate mission i asked.,-47.53599166870117,8
8455-210777-0044,I was to be taken away and carried to england or elsewhere or drowned upon the voyage it mattered not which.,-107.31135559082031,22
8455-210777-0045,Then the republic of britannula was to be declared as non existent and the british flag was to be exalted and a british governor installed in the executive chambers.,-144.11749267578125,37
8455-210777-0046,You may be quite sure it's there said captain battleax and that i can so use it as to half obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board.,-175.97491455078125,34
8455-210777-0047,You propose to kidnap me i said.,-45.07026672363281,7
8455-210777-0048,What would become of your gun were i to kidnap you.,-53.572296142578125,11
8455-210777-0049,Lieutenant crosstrees is a very gallant officer.,-54.57151412963867,12
8455-210777-0050,One of us always remains on board while the other is on shore.,-46.81062316894531,13
8455-210777-0051,What world wide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible my dislike centred itself on sir ferdinando.,-250.55035400390625,46
8455-210777-0052,You will allow me to suggest said he that that is a matter of opinion.,-67.74287414550781,15
8455-210777-0053,Were i to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion i should seem to have done so willingly hereafter.,-98.88340759277344,21
8455-210777-0054,The letter ran as follows.,-26.221824645996094,5
8455-210777-0055,Sir i have it in command to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crown colony which is called britannula.,-121.54338836669922,29
8455-210777-0056,The peculiar circumstances of the colony are within your excellency's knowledge.,-57.82048034667969,14
8455-210777-0057,But in their selection of a constitution the britannulists have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberative assembly and hence have sprung their present difficulties.,-154.98727416992188,29
8455-210777-0058,It is founded on the acknowledged weakness of those who survive that period of life at which men cease to work.,-88.958984375,21
8455-210777-0059,But it is surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your government.,-84.52985382080078,22
8455-210777-0060,The john bright is armed with a weapon of great power against which it is impossible that the people of britannula should prevail.,-125.97789001464844,26
8455-210777-0061,You will carry out with you one hundred men of the north north west birmingham regiment which will probably suffice for your own security as it is thought that if mister neverbend be withdrawn the people will revert easily to their old habits of obedience.,-226.90057373046875,49
8455-210777-0062,When do you intend that the john bright shall start.,-69.11717224121094,10
8455-210777-0063,To day i shouted.,-36.89360046386719,4
8455-210777-0064,And i have no one ready to whom i can give up the archives of the government.,-72.00550842285156,17
8455-210777-0065,I shall be happy to take charge of them said sir ferdinando.,-66.89234924316406,14
8455-210777-0066,They of course must all be altered.,-36.11174774169922,7
8455-210777-0067,Or of the habits of our people it is quite impossible.,-49.51170349121094,11
8455-210777-0068,Your power is sufficient i said.,-33.469398498535156,6
8455-210777-0069,If you will give us your promise to meet captain battleax here at this time to morrow we will stretch a point and delay the departure of the john bright for twenty four hours.,-179.249267578125,36
8455-210777-0070,And this plan was adopted too in order to extract from me a promise that i would depart in peace.,-88.64433288574219,20
