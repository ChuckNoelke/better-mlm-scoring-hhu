brown.013958,We now have certain squares with three corners on C.,-44.03898572921753,13
brown.013959,"Each point on C, as a vertex, may possess a finite number of corresponding diagonal points by the above construction.",-52.160526752471924,25
brown.013960,"We note that two such curves C and Af, cannot coincide at more than a finite number of points.",-51.5624885559082,24
brown.013961,"Otherwise, being analytic, they would coincide at all points, which is impossible since they do not coincide near Af.",-41.835150718688965,27
brown.013962,"For the vertex at Af, these values will be denoted by Af.",-28.506400108337402,18
brown.013963,"The graph, as a set, may have a finite number of components.",-19.282377243041992,17
brown.013964,Each point with abscissa T on the graph represents an intersection between C and Af.,-53.08564853668213,22
brown.013965,"There are two types of such intersections, depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point of intersection.",-28.916471481323242,24
brown.013966,Any other point of intersection between C and Af will be called a tangent point.,-25.779519081115723,20
brown.013967,This terminology will also be applied to the corresponding points in the Aj.,-39.603657245635986,17
brown.013968,We can now prove several lemmas.,-13.012232780456543,11
brown.013969,We first show that the function is single-valued in some neighborhood.,-24.556475162506104,16
brown.013970,In the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are Af.,-28.02543020248413,17
brown.013971,We know that in the C-plane both C and Af are analytic.,-23.009679794311523,19
brown.013972,"Near Q, both curves can be represented by analytic functions of U.",-42.44555711746216,17
brown.013973,"In a neighborhood of Q the difference between these functions is also a single-valued, analytic function of U.",-34.51841735839844,25
brown.013974,"Now, to find Af, one needs the intersection of C and Af near Q.",-35.82273721694946,21
brown.013975,The arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve.,-15.53747844696045,14
brown.013976,"Therefore, Af is single-valued near Q.",-34.537538051605225,13
brown.013977,"It is also seen that Af, since the change from Af to Af is accomplished by a continuous translation.",-53.42804431915283,26
brown.013978,"Thus Af is also continuous at Af, and in a neighborhood of Af which does not contain a tangent point.",-33.101797103881836,28
brown.013979,We turn now to the set of tangent points on the graph.,-22.486329555511475,16
brown.013980,This set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals.,-24.985844612121582,13
brown.013981,This prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points.,-21.319202423095703,16
brown.013982,A tangent point Q in the C-plane occurs when C and Af are tangent to one another.,-33.20348501205444,25
brown.013983,In the second category the function Af has no values defined in a neighborhood Af.,-34.82128715515137,20
brown.013984,In the third category the function is double-valued in this interval.,-31.811731338500977,16
brown.013985,The same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of Af.,-35.08817720413208,17
brown.013986,"Again, the analyticity of the two curves guarantees that such intervals exist.",-26.407078742980957,18
brown.013987,With the above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of F.,-30.210131645202637,18
brown.013988,The graph of f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval Aj.,-45.23497200012207,20
brown.013989,Then every component of the graph of F must be defined over a bounded sub-interval.,-38.74352025985718,20
brown.013990,Suppose Af is defined in the sub-interval Af.,-18.64509868621826,17
brown.013991,Now Af and Af must both be tangent points on the T component in the f-plane.,-51.023197174072266,24
brown.013992,Otherwise by Lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these points.,-34.13440752029419,15
brown.013993,Thus the multiplicity of Af for a given T must be an even number.,-28.856744289398193,20
brown.013994,This is true of all components which have such a bounded support.,-31.31922483444214,15
brown.013995,"There must be an odd number of such components, which will be called complete components.",-23.011384963989258,19
brown.013996,We again consider a fixed point P at Af and a variable point Q at Af on C.,-35.53236198425293,23
brown.013997,"We have Af, plus tangent points.",-32.614930152893066,12
brown.013998,These s-values are just the ordinary values of Af.,-29.553404808044434,15
brown.013999,The functions F and B have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument T.,-33.440489292144775,19
brown.014000,No generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible.,-23.959836959838867,22
brown.014001,The line Af is the image of L.,-32.517964363098145,12
brown.014002,"Clearly, the transformation is involutorial.",-20.326549530029297,13
brown.014003,"We observe first that no line, l, can meet its image except at one of its intersections with Q.",-50.9024019241333,25
brown.014004,"For if it did, the plane of L and l' would contain two generators of Af, which is impossible.",-65.26250982284546,26
brown.014005,Hence the totality of singular lines is the T order complex of lines which meet Aj.,-68.64479160308838,21
brown.014006,"There are various sets of exceptional lines, or lines whose images are not unique.",-33.75992679595947,18
brown.014007,Thus pencils of tangents to Q are transformed into pencils of tangents.,-14.567538261413574,21
brown.014008,"In particular, tangents to C are transformed into tangents to C'.",-12.579567909240723,20
brown.014009,The congruence of its secants is therefore of order Af and class Af.,-28.821956634521484,23
brown.014010,"In other words, these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all.",-21.278529167175293,18
brown.014011,"Hence its image, C', meets any line of Af in Af points.",-60.15393590927124,20
brown.014012,"Moreover, C' obviously meets any line Af in a single point.",-59.02565383911133,17
brown.014013,Hence C' is a Af curve on Q.,-55.92857646942139,13
brown.014014,We now shall show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described.,-39.83051681518555,24
brown.014015,"To see this, consider a general pencil of lines containing a general secant of Aj.",-49.467702865600586,22
brown.014016,"From the preceding remarks, it is clear that such a bundle is transformed into itself in an involutorial fashion.",-33.483521461486816,27
brown.014017,"In each case, lines of the bundles are transformed by involutions within the pencils they determine with the multiple secant.",-82.7738242149353,31
brown.014018,"The multiple secants, of course, are exceptional and in each case are transformed into cones of order Af.",-49.294551849365234,26
brown.014019,Observations similar to these can be made at each point of Aj.,-24.397839546203613,19
brown.014020,"Moreover, if Af, no two of the multiple secants can intersect.",-40.55879497528076,20
brown.014021,"Now consider an arbitrary line, l, meeting Q in two points, Af and Af.",-48.21203851699829,22

brown.020268,Where was Muller waiting with the rifle??,-40.08858108520508,11

brown.020276,Almost at once a figure bulked up.,-11.878124237060547,11

brown.020281,If only the latter were true.,-8.905681610107422,9
brown.020282,He walked rapidly along the buildings scanning their facades: one was a club -- that was out.,-58.33229112625122,23
brown.020283,Two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted.,-36.45736074447632,15
brown.020284,"That left three, possibly four, one looking much like the next.",-23.030075550079346,16
brown.020285,He climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule.,-13.811810493469238,19
brown.020286,He quickly closed it again.,-6.227252006530762,8
brown.020287,That made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance.,-28.01016139984131,22
brown.020288,He went on to the next building and found what he expected -- the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule.,-32.378581047058105,30
brown.020289,On one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes.,-22.020071029663086,17
brown.020290,The names on the mailboxes meant nothing to him.,-4.482295989990234,14
brown.020291,This was senseless -- he had no idea what to look for.,-12.8903169631958,17

brown.020295,Had Muller made the same deduction??,-25.615233421325684,11
brown.020296,Muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes.,-17.76015567779541,14
brown.020297,He opened the inner door.,-7.962522983551025,8

brown.020305,He could not break in on an armed man.,-19.435418128967285,12
brown.020306,He would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop.,-26.982176780700684,17
brown.020307,His thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door.,-25.14518165588379,21
brown.020308,He stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill.,-32.16564083099365,20
