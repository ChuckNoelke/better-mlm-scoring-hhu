brown.013966,Any other point of intersection between C and Af will be called a tangent point.,-177.50774955749512,20
brown.013967,This terminology will also be applied to the corresponding points in the Aj.,-138.79916191101074,17
brown.013968,We can now prove several lemmas.,-91.76605463027954,11
brown.013969,We first show that the function is single-valued in some neighborhood.,-108.43320941925049,16
brown.013970,In the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are Af.,-110.5510573387146,17
brown.013971,We know that in the C-plane both C and Af are analytic.,-139.7555694580078,19
brown.013972,"Near Q, both curves can be represented by analytic functions of U.",-126.95376586914062,17
brown.013973,"In a neighborhood of Q the difference between these functions is also a single-valued, analytic function of U.",-198.98074531555176,25
brown.013974,"Now, to find Af, one needs the intersection of C and Af near Q.",-151.03724575042725,21
brown.013975,The arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve.,-94.04140853881836,14
brown.013976,"Therefore, Af is single-valued near Q.",-92.67967987060547,13
brown.013977,"It is also seen that Af, since the change from Af to Af is accomplished by a continuous translation.",-161.84257745742798,26
brown.013978,"Thus Af is also continuous at Af, and in a neighborhood of Af which does not contain a tangent point.",-176.0665798187256,28
brown.013979,We turn now to the set of tangent points on the graph.,-116.60896348953247,16
brown.013980,This set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals.,-101.43118190765381,13
brown.013981,This prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points.,-147.4924612045288,16
brown.013982,A tangent point Q in the C-plane occurs when C and Af are tangent to one another.,-184.35714149475098,25
brown.013983,In the second category the function Af has no values defined in a neighborhood Af.,-176.56177377700806,20
brown.013984,In the third category the function is double-valued in this interval.,-142.2427978515625,16
brown.013985,The same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of Af.,-167.3545742034912,17
brown.013986,"Again, the analyticity of the two curves guarantees that such intervals exist.",-130.61856698989868,18
brown.013987,With the above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of F.,-139.27450037002563,18
brown.013988,The graph of f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval Aj.,-151.12326526641846,20
brown.013989,Then every component of the graph of F must be defined over a bounded sub-interval.,-169.57910108566284,20
brown.013990,Suppose Af is defined in the sub-interval Af.,-120.83152914047241,17
brown.013991,Now Af and Af must both be tangent points on the T component in the f-plane.,-160.637544631958,24
brown.013992,Otherwise by Lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these points.,-114.70881509780884,15
brown.013993,Thus the multiplicity of Af for a given T must be an even number.,-135.44030952453613,20
brown.013994,This is true of all components which have such a bounded support.,-108.2993311882019,15
brown.013995,"There must be an odd number of such components, which will be called complete components.",-145.4371919631958,19
brown.013996,We again consider a fixed point P at Af and a variable point Q at Af on C.,-168.33770751953125,23
brown.013997,"We have Af, plus tangent points.",-86.73039865493774,12
brown.013998,These s-values are just the ordinary values of Af.,-85.76095628738403,15
brown.013999,The functions F and B have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument T.,-132.3056926727295,19
brown.014000,No generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible.,-186.31151390075684,22
brown.014001,The line Af is the image of L.,-73.3994460105896,12
brown.014002,"Clearly, the transformation is involutorial.",-104.24113130569458,13
brown.014003,"We observe first that no line, l, can meet its image except at one of its intersections with Q.",-181.5419373512268,25
brown.014004,"For if it did, the plane of L and l' would contain two generators of Af, which is impossible.",-164.49905729293823,26
brown.014005,Hence the totality of singular lines is the T order complex of lines which meet Aj.,-190.11870336532593,21
brown.014006,"There are various sets of exceptional lines, or lines whose images are not unique.",-149.47437810897827,18
brown.014007,Thus pencils of tangents to Q are transformed into pencils of tangents.,-154.0011281967163,21
brown.014008,"In particular, tangents to C are transformed into tangents to C'.",-124.11761140823364,20
brown.014009,The congruence of its secants is therefore of order Af and class Af.,-142.48754167556763,23
brown.014010,"In other words, these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all.",-162.35407495498657,18
brown.014011,"Hence its image, C', meets any line of Af in Af points.",-141.46344232559204,20
brown.014012,"Moreover, C' obviously meets any line Af in a single point.",-121.90318155288696,17
brown.014013,Hence C' is a Af curve on Q.,-84.91411924362183,13
brown.014014,We now shall show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described.,-163.04549932479858,24
brown.014015,"To see this, consider a general pencil of lines containing a general secant of Aj.",-179.01400804519653,22
brown.014016,"From the preceding remarks, it is clear that such a bundle is transformed into itself in an involutorial fashion.",-226.88949251174927,27
brown.014017,"In each case, lines of the bundles are transformed by involutions within the pencils they determine with the multiple secant.",-223.14090394973755,31
brown.014018,"The multiple secants, of course, are exceptional and in each case are transformed into cones of order Af.",-165.8433575630188,26
brown.014019,Observations similar to these can be made at each point of Aj.,-148.48958730697632,19
brown.014020,"Moreover, if Af, no two of the multiple secants can intersect.",-152.4148349761963,20
brown.014021,"Now consider an arbitrary line, l, meeting Q in two points, Af and Af.",-167.97873401641846,22

brown.025563,Her face was flushed from sleep.,-79.42206859588623,9
brown.025564,She didn't look over thirteen.,-60.19767713546753,10
brown.025565,And Nadine insisted that her sitters be reliable!!,-117.24951410293579,14
brown.025566,I crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone.,-119.01814937591553,15
brown.025567,"I told Nadine everything was fine, and that I'd be getting on home.",-132.37022304534912,20

brown.025584,Ken will never forgive him -- never!!,-100.04792547225952,12
brown.025585,And we don't have any money -- we don't have a dime!!,-135.8369016647339,22
brown.025586,All we own is Francie's bedroom set and the televison-record player and we even owe on them.,-194.38958978652954,28
brown.025587,I clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of filth.,-142.40549039840698,18

brown.025601,"Wally sat in our big chair, his hands between his knees, looking ready to cry.",-138.35609483718872,20
brown.025602,Seems that the kid Wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side.,-192.45668172836304,21
brown.025603,"Mr. Thom had gotten Wally on the phone, and fired him.",-121.47473526000977,16

brown.025605,But she was beyond caring what she said.,-97.16407060623169,11
brown.025606,But I couldn't help thinking that Nadine and Wally were getting just what they deserved.,-146.8746566772461,21

brown.025619,"It was incredible -- He gave me an embarrassed, pleading look.",-105.34889221191406,16
brown.025620,Straightened out -- They'd had years of making all that money!!,-141.48910856246948,19
brown.025621,"Then I felt uncomfortable, too.",-109.10042142868042,9

brown.025630,"It was a mess, all right.",-76.89894390106201,10
brown.025631,"But it couldn't go on forever -- A couple of weeks, Chris had said.",-109.33487749099731,21
brown.025632,I figured I could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks.,-116.52349805831909,15
brown.025633,"But the two weeks dragged into three, and they were still with us.",-133.96337032318115,17
brown.025634,Nadine's constant nagging had finally gotten Wally out of bed.,-140.67348527908325,17

brown.025637,Nobody would even take his application.,-92.71738147735596,9
brown.025638,But this was only the middle of July.,-80.57532501220703,11

brown.025642,"Part of it was the weather, so foggy it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital.",-149.5715479850769,25
brown.025643,"But the rest of it, the main part, wasn't based on logic at all.",-120.69801902770996,21

brown.025661,Should I tell him the truth about Alice??,-115.0095705986023,12
brown.025662,Did he have a right to know the secret I'd kept from Gladdy all these years??,-158.8505368232727,23
brown.025663,The boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when I got to Fairview.,-159.30397987365723,20
