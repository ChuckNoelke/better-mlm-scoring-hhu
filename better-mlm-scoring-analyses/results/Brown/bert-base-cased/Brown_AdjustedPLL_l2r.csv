brown.009543,The Registry of Motor Vehicles indicates that at least one state automobile was registered as far back as 1917.,-33.624234199523926,24
brown.009544,It should be enough to say that the practice of the state buying automobiles is at least forty years old.,-35.45684480667114,23

brown.009551,Whether there were too few automobiles in 1940 or too many now is problematical.,-35.98271989822388,18
brown.009552,The fact is simply that state-owned vehicles have remained in practically the same proportion as employees to use them.,-55.41044092178345,24

brown.009595,Only four towns indicated that they made any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind.,-55.086002349853516,22
brown.009596,Of greater interest is a question as to whether movable property was assessed according to its location or ownership.,-56.070637226104736,24

brown.013826,"If we try to study T using characteristic values, we are confronted with two problems.",-40.54524850845337,19
brown.013827,"First, T may not have a single characteristic value.",-34.17515754699707,13
brown.013828,"This is really a deficiency in the scalar field, namely, that it is not algebraically closed.",-46.92089653015137,24
brown.013829,This is clearly a deficiency in T.,-24.151140213012695,10
brown.013830,Thus T is not diagonalizable.,-34.54876947402954,10
brown.013831,One sees that this happens because the null space of Af has dimension 1 only.,-36.4438099861145,19
brown.013832,This will be more or less our general method for the second problem.,-33.000096797943115,16
brown.013833,The diagonalizable operator is the special case of this in which Af for each i.,-59.887861251831055,21
brown.013834,Let T be a linear operator on the finite-dimensional vector space V over the field F.,-19.23104763031006,21
brown.013835,Let Af be the null space of Af.,-18.633726596832275,13
brown.013836,The idea of the proof is this.,-24.47738552093506,10
brown.013837,The projection Af will be the identity on Af and zero on the other Af.,-46.69267988204956,21
brown.013838,"For each i, let Af.",-25.696526527404785,10
brown.013839,Thus there are polynomials Af such that Af.,-23.5695538520813,14
brown.013840,We shall show that the polynomials Af behave in the manner described in the first paragraph of the proof.,-40.429349422454834,24
brown.013841,"Since Af and P divides Af for Af, we have Af.",-43.37154817581177,19
brown.013842,Thus the Af are projections which correspond to some direct-sum decomposition of the space V.,-56.341050148010254,21
brown.013843,We wish to show that the range of Af is exactly the subspace Af.,-43.50198030471802,20
brown.013844,"If Af, then Af is divisible by Af and so Af, i.e., Af.",-50.4659366607666,29
brown.013845,It is certainly clear that the subspaces Af are invariant under T.,-46.38332414627075,18
brown.013846,This shows that the minimal polynomial for Af divides Af.,-28.860971927642822,15
brown.013847,"Conversely, let G be any polynomial such that Af.",-27.255629539489746,14
brown.013848,"Thus Af is divisible by the minimal polynomial P of T, i.e., Af divides Af.",-64.51066732406616,28
brown.013849,It is easily seen that Af divides G.,-42.80375051498413,12
brown.013850,Hence the minimal polynomial for Af is Af.,-26.622549533843994,13

brown.013862,Hence they commute with D and with N.,-33.44085884094238,13

brown.013870,"But then since the operator is diagonalizable, the minimal polynomial cannot have a repeated root.",-65.0773515701294,21

brown.013986,"Again, the analyticity of the two curves guarantees that such intervals exist.",-36.70974254608154,18
brown.013987,With the above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of F.,-30.210129261016846,18
brown.013988,The graph of f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval Aj.,-48.41389608383179,20
brown.013989,Then every component of the graph of F must be defined over a bounded sub-interval.,-38.743534564971924,20
brown.013990,Suppose Af is defined in the sub-interval Af.,-46.344332218170166,17
brown.013991,Now Af and Af must both be tangent points on the T component in the f-plane.,-59.05970096588135,24
brown.013992,Otherwise by Lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these points.,-41.2346830368042,15
brown.013993,Thus the multiplicity of Af for a given T must be an even number.,-46.84298610687256,20
brown.013994,This is true of all components which have such a bounded support.,-31.319209575653076,15
brown.013995,"There must be an odd number of such components, which will be called complete components.",-23.01138687133789,19
brown.013996,We again consider a fixed point P at Af and a variable point Q at Af on C.,-38.471949100494385,23
brown.013997,"We have Af, plus tangent points.",-47.32091283798218,12
brown.013998,These s-values are just the ordinary values of Af.,-31.21936273574829,15
brown.013999,The functions F and B have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument T.,-53.4100227355957,19
brown.014000,No generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible.,-30.29936122894287,22
brown.014001,The line Af is the image of L.,-33.45577144622803,12
brown.014002,"Clearly, the transformation is involutorial.",-47.9959831237793,13
brown.014003,"We observe first that no line, l, can meet its image except at one of its intersections with Q.",-53.36019229888916,25
brown.014004,"For if it did, the plane of L and l' would contain two generators of Af, which is impossible.",-68.19647789001465,26
brown.014005,Hence the totality of singular lines is the T order complex of lines which meet Aj.,-75.2029709815979,21
brown.014006,"There are various sets of exceptional lines, or lines whose images are not unique.",-33.759928703308105,18
brown.014007,Thus pencils of tangents to Q are transformed into pencils of tangents.,-44.63417100906372,21
brown.014008,"In particular, tangents to C are transformed into tangents to C'.",-25.41840934753418,20
brown.014009,The congruence of its secants is therefore of order Af and class Af.,-65.48694705963135,23
brown.014010,"In other words, these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all.",-26.215632438659668,18
brown.014011,"Hence its image, C', meets any line of Af in Af points.",-74.74475240707397,20
brown.014012,"Moreover, C' obviously meets any line Af in a single point.",-58.73720741271973,17
brown.014013,Hence C' is a Af curve on Q.,-56.606417179107666,13
brown.014014,We now shall show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described.,-53.89670944213867,24
brown.014015,"To see this, consider a general pencil of lines containing a general secant of Aj.",-71.98349380493164,22

brown.014017,"In each case, lines of the bundles are transformed by involutions within the pencils they determine with the multiple secant.",-121.0178656578064,31
brown.014018,"The multiple secants, of course, are exceptional and in each case are transformed into cones of order Af.",-73.01644325256348,26
brown.014019,Observations similar to these can be made at each point of Aj.,-58.8856897354126,19
brown.014020,"Moreover, if Af, no two of the multiple secants can intersect.",-72.750328540802,20

brown.014494,"An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems, including some of the more unusual types.",-51.663482666015625,25

brown.014508,Actual practice does not often work out this way.,-26.711222648620605,13
brown.014509,Welmers has suggested one explanation.,-39.88906383514404,10
brown.014510,Tone languages use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use.,-110.83905935287476,22
brown.014511,This may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable.,-64.87586212158203,24

brown.014527,"Consonantal systems are not merely larger, they are multidimensional.",-66.69615459442139,19

brown.020255,Wide windows with many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories.,-33.21497344970703,17

brown.020259,"It was framed in maroon drapes, and no faces were visible.",-47.54884052276611,18
brown.020260,This would be Mahzeer's office.,-31.866559505462646,13
brown.020261,"He and the prime minister would be back from the window, seated at Mahzeer's desk.",-56.71997117996216,24

brown.020268,Where was Muller waiting with the rifle??,-40.088579177856445,11
brown.020269,Narrow four-story buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf.,-29.623908042907715,22
brown.020270,Most of them could be eliminated.,-13.329137802124023,9
brown.020271,Muller's would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly opposite.,-30.920242309570312,18
brown.020272,The legation was generously set back from the building line.,-45.805126667022705,15

brown.020276,Almost at once a figure bulked up.,-18.759113311767578,11

brown.020280,The room's occupants were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain.,-46.9102144241333,24
brown.020281,If only the latter were true.,-8.905688285827637,9
brown.020282,He walked rapidly along the buildings scanning their facades: one was a club -- that was out.,-63.755842208862305,23
brown.020283,Two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted.,-40.0382022857666,15
brown.020284,"That left three, possibly four, one looking much like the next.",-23.030076503753662,16
brown.020285,He climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule.,-36.695383071899414,19
brown.020286,He quickly closed it again.,-6.227250099182129,8
brown.020287,That made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance.,-28.010159492492676,22
brown.020288,He went on to the next building and found what he expected -- the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule.,-83.00420379638672,30
brown.020289,On one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes.,-32.154611110687256,17
brown.020290,The names on the mailboxes meant nothing to him.,-12.401803493499756,14
brown.020291,This was senseless -- he had no idea what to look for.,-23.812954902648926,17
brown.020292,He peered in the boxes themselves.,-19.75259304046631,9

brown.020295,Had Muller made the same deduction??,-36.15725517272949,11
brown.020296,Muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes.,-43.26803207397461,14
brown.020297,He opened the inner door.,-7.962515830993652,8
brown.020298,"The cooking odors were stronger -- all over the city, at this hour, housewives would be fussing over stoves.",-63.52881717681885,30
brown.020299,Now he was certain: the lock had not yielded to Muller's collection of keys.,-44.36713981628418,20
brown.020300,Fresh scars showed that the door had been prized open.,-47.07735872268677,14
brown.020301,"It had been shut again, but the lock was broken.",-13.256470680236816,14
brown.020302,He noted with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch.,-24.806228160858154,17
brown.020303,What was he to do now??,-8.85594654083252,10
brown.020304,He had thought no further than finding Muller.,-30.83068084716797,11
brown.020305,He could not break in on an armed man.,-19.435418128967285,12
brown.020306,He would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop.,-26.982184886932373,17
brown.020307,His thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door.,-25.14517879486084,21
brown.020308,He stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill.,-45.35996437072754,20
brown.020309,Hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled for the switch: evil flourishes in the dark.,-61.45416069030762,24
brown.020310,The room was bathed in light at the instant Muller's second shot came.,-38.06409692764282,19
brown.020311,His face wore a look of outrage.,-10.154444694519043,10
brown.020312,A shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain.,-28.120371341705322,14
