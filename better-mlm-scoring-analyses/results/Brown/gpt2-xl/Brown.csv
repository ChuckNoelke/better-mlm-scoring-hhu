brown.012987,"All they could think of was to run around in circles, kicking their legs out.",-57.03548812866211,17
brown.012988,"Then, they said General Burnside was going to jump over his horse's head.",-70.60609436035156,17
brown.012989,And they did some somersaults.,-31.953630447387695,8
brown.012990,"But that wasn't very funny, either.",-30.037458419799805,9

brown.012993,"They were clumsy, but they were beginning to catch on.",-41.53371047973633,12
brown.012994,They also caught on a little bit on how to smile a lot without your lips trembling.,-77.3348159790039,18
brown.012995,That helped a great deal.,-24.93145751953125,6

brown.012998,The children rushed off to get rid of their sweaters.,-50.01118850708008,12
brown.012999,And Arlene began tapping the kitchen door open.,-57.305965423583984,10
brown.013000,"But he said it too soon, for it came out just before the tap to which the door responded.",-97.85052490234375,21
brown.013001,That tap had a slight bangish quality.,-57.6804084777832,9
brown.013002,Her upper lip lifted slightly.,-32.19055938720703,6
brown.013003,She was biting into a small red radish.,-41.35952377319336,10
brown.013004,And that action always caused her to lift her lip from the sting of the thing.,-77.28126525878906,17
brown.013005,But it made her look unusual.,-34.84203338623047,7
brown.013006,"Also, when she had bitten off half of the small radish, she found the suspense unbearable.",-87.40856170654297,20

brown.013008,"One could hear a very faint, ladylike sigh of relief.",-55.89061737060547,13
brown.013009,"Actually, it was inaudible to anyone not expecting it.",-47.548824310302734,13

brown.013032,"This could be told chiefly from a sort of head-tossing and prancing, a horselike balkiness of demeanor.",-124.28804016113281,27
brown.013033,"Possibly, the coconut-containing dessert had brought up bitter problems of administration.",-95.79176330566406,16
brown.013034,"But, at the beginning, this stayed just in the air.",-50.59016799926758,13

brown.013036,"He asked, between wheezes of laughter.",-39.04195785522461,10
brown.013037,He was forced to wipe his eyes.,-31.774627685546875,8
brown.013038,One of the children maneuvered out of range of the poking index finger.,-68.76660919189453,15
brown.013039,Mr. Gorboduc took a swig of his sherry.,-63.13344955444336,15

brown.013845,It is certainly clear that the subspaces Af are invariant under T.,-78.50528717041016,16

brown.013965,"There are two types of such intersections, depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point of intersection.",-71.363525390625,21
brown.013966,Any other point of intersection between C and Af will be called a tangent point.,-79.79057312011719,17
brown.013967,This terminology will also be applied to the corresponding points in the Aj.,-71.87202453613281,14
brown.013968,We can now prove several lemmas.,-40.86528778076172,9
brown.013969,We first show that the function is single-valued in some neighborhood.,-61.78534698486328,14
brown.013970,In the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are Af.,-71.95333099365234,14
brown.013971,We know that in the C-plane both C and Af are analytic.,-77.25318145751953,15
brown.013972,"Near Q, both curves can be represented by analytic functions of U.",-75.72322845458984,14
brown.013973,"In a neighborhood of Q the difference between these functions is also a single-valued, analytic function of U.",-114.7570571899414,22
brown.013974,"Now, to find Af, one needs the intersection of C and Af near Q.",-93.27529907226562,17
brown.013975,The arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve.,-56.24759292602539,11
brown.013976,"Therefore, Af is single-valued near Q.",-73.19410705566406,10
brown.013977,"It is also seen that Af, since the change from Af to Af is accomplished by a continuous translation.",-100.8107681274414,21
brown.013978,"Thus Af is also continuous at Af, and in a neighborhood of Af which does not contain a tangent point.",-114.09886932373047,23
brown.013979,We turn now to the set of tangent points on the graph.,-52.5707893371582,14
brown.013980,This set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals.,-63.139007568359375,11
brown.013981,This prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points.,-66.68991088867188,14
brown.013982,A tangent point Q in the C-plane occurs when C and Af are tangent to one another.,-98.809326171875,22
brown.013983,In the second category the function Af has no values defined in a neighborhood Af.,-97.42620086669922,16
brown.013984,In the third category the function is double-valued in this interval.,-68.31682586669922,14
brown.013985,The same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of Af.,-69.16493225097656,14
brown.013986,"Again, the analyticity of the two curves guarantees that such intervals exist.",-75.40802001953125,16
brown.013987,With the above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of F.,-61.47408676147461,16
brown.013988,The graph of f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval Aj.,-95.11470794677734,17
brown.013989,Then every component of the graph of F must be defined over a bounded sub-interval.,-85.84334564208984,19
brown.013990,Suppose Af is defined in the sub-interval Af.,-71.42525482177734,13
brown.013991,Now Af and Af must both be tangent points on the T component in the f-plane.,-105.05748748779297,20
brown.013992,Otherwise by Lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these points.,-85.27525329589844,13
brown.013993,Thus the multiplicity of Af for a given T must be an even number.,-72.67462158203125,16
brown.013994,This is true of all components which have such a bounded support.,-61.79401779174805,13
brown.013995,"There must be an odd number of such components, which will be called complete components.",-69.42720031738281,17
brown.013996,We again consider a fixed point P at Af and a variable point Q at Af on C.,-97.9819564819336,19
brown.013997,"We have Af, plus tangent points.",-62.46642303466797,9
brown.013998,These s-values are just the ordinary values of Af.,-67.58863067626953,12
brown.013999,The functions F and B have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument T.,-76.1231689453125,16
brown.014000,No generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible.,-84.69855499267578,20
brown.014001,The line Af is the image of L.,-59.91453552246094,9
brown.014002,"Clearly, the transformation is involutorial.",-56.336055755615234,8
brown.014003,"We observe first that no line, l, can meet its image except at one of its intersections with Q.",-102.22279357910156,22
brown.014004,"For if it did, the plane of L and l' would contain two generators of Af, which is impossible.",-119.44872283935547,23
brown.014005,Hence the totality of singular lines is the T order complex of lines which meet Aj.,-119.26728820800781,18
brown.014006,"There are various sets of exceptional lines, or lines whose images are not unique.",-74.6446533203125,16
brown.014007,Thus pencils of tangents to Q are transformed into pencils of tangents.,-84.29332733154297,17
brown.014008,"In particular, tangents to C are transformed into tangents to C'.",-66.75643157958984,15
brown.014009,The congruence of its secants is therefore of order Af and class Af.,-101.95365142822266,17
brown.014010,"In other words, these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all.",-70.3173828125,15
brown.014011,"Hence its image, C', meets any line of Af in Af points.",-118.00761413574219,16
brown.014012,"Moreover, C' obviously meets any line Af in a single point.",-98.85167694091797,14
brown.014013,Hence C' is a Af curve on Q.,-78.03507995605469,11
brown.014014,We now shall show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described.,-84.90885925292969,21
brown.014015,"To see this, consider a general pencil of lines containing a general secant of Aj.",-110.94866943359375,18

brown.014019,Observations similar to these can be made at each point of Aj.,-69.8603515625,15
brown.014020,"Moreover, if Af, no two of the multiple secants can intersect.",-91.74992370605469,15
brown.014021,"Now consider an arbitrary line, l, meeting Q in two points, Af and Af.",-89.16433715820312,18

brown.014494,"An advanced student has read a considerable number of descriptions of consonantal systems, including some of the more unusual types.",-97.5220718383789,24

brown.014508,Actual practice does not often work out this way.,-36.957275390625,11
brown.014509,Welmers has suggested one explanation.,-48.57628631591797,8
brown.014510,Tone languages use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use.,-111.35076904296875,20
brown.014511,This may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable.,-68.09339141845703,19
brown.014512,The problem is to disentangle the linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic features.,-74.76982879638672,24

brown.014514,"With tone, individual differences may be greater than the linguistic contrasts which are superimposed on them.",-89.00360107421875,19
brown.014515,A second explanation is suggested by the material described in Rowlands' paper.,-60.227481842041016,15
brown.014516,Tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed.,-56.54462432861328,13

brown.014518,"For example, duration sometimes figures in both the vowel system and the intonation.",-74.87126159667969,17

brown.014527,"Consonantal systems are not merely larger, they are multidimensional.",-63.11833953857422,16
brown.014528,Morphophonemic rules may be thought of as joining certain points in the system.,-83.83821105957031,17
brown.014529,"The possibilities in the consonantal system are very numerous, and only a small portion of them are actually used.",-68.12606048583984,23

brown.014531,"The possibilities are few, and the total number of rules may be considerably greater.",-61.81028747558594,16
brown.014532,The statement of the system is a different matter.,-40.55526351928711,10

brown.020228,He bit out the words.,-29.793495178222656,6

brown.020230,"On the second landing he paused to look for Docherty, didn't see him, and accepted a glass of champagne.",-96.09730529785156,24

brown.020233,At the top a uniformed officer blocked further progress.,-52.47562789916992,11

brown.020241,Docherty went taut: was it possible??,-70.3439712524414,10
brown.020242,Could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister feared??,-88.39462280273438,15
brown.020243,The prime minister knew who his enemy was here.,-43.94584274291992,10
brown.020244,He wasn't going to allow himself to be led meekly to the slaughter.,-48.0502815246582,17
brown.020245,One more muddleheaded play like that one and they'd be leading him away.,-88.51016235351562,17
brown.020246,"Still, this had to be checked out.",-36.73069763183594,9
brown.020247,"Troubled, he continued along the corridor, poking his head into the next office for a careful look around.",-79.45120239257812,23
brown.020248,But Hoag had not stayed on the front steps when Griffith disappeared into the building.,-87.11384582519531,17
brown.020249,He would have to do something on his own.,-31.406089782714844,10
brown.020250,The door opened and three men and a woman in a sari swept past him and down the stairs.,-67.86272430419922,21
brown.020251,In the lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their wraps.,-75.04235076904297,16
brown.020252,These were the early departures.,-32.006744384765625,6
brown.020253,In half an hour the reception would be over.,-38.745174407958984,10
brown.020254,Hoag descended the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building.,-60.67264938354492,16
brown.020255,Wide windows with many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories.,-77.89774322509766,15
brown.020256,On the second floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests.,-57.13127517700195,14
brown.020257,The scene looked like a Christmas card.,-31.786598205566406,8
brown.020258,On the third floor one of the two windows was lighted.,-46.51655960083008,13
brown.020259,"It was framed in maroon drapes, and no faces were visible.",-57.64686965942383,16
brown.020260,This would be Mahzeer's office.,-47.10765838623047,9
brown.020261,"He and the prime minister would be back from the window, seated at Mahzeer's desk.",-92.67330932617188,20
brown.020262,They would be going over papers Mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting.,-110.75,19
brown.020263,"In a minute, or five minutes, the business would be done.",-50.470298767089844,14
brown.020264,"Mahzeer would stand up, the prime minister would follow.",-62.891517639160156,13
brown.020265,The single shot would come.,-35.645599365234375,6

brown.020268,Where was Muller waiting with the rifle??,-54.68932342529297,8
brown.020269,Narrow four-story buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf.,-81.73683166503906,20
brown.020270,Most of them could be eliminated.,-28.100116729736328,7
brown.020271,Muller's would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly opposite.,-76.71520233154297,17
brown.020272,The legation was generously set back from the building line.,-62.23317337036133,12
brown.020273,If the angle of fire were too great the jutting buildings on either side would interfere.,-79.77355194091797,19
brown.020274,Would the shot come from a roof??,-50.205692291259766,8
brown.020275,He ran his eye along the roof copings.,-56.33951950073242,10
brown.020276,Almost at once a figure bulked up.,-49.415470123291016,9
brown.020277,But dully glinting on the dark form were the buttons and badge of a policeman.,-87.2571792602539,19
brown.020278,"Hoag crossed the narrow street, squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk.",-67.23052978515625,16
brown.020279,"From this side he could see farther into the legation's third-story window, but he saw no faces.",-93.2413558959961,23
brown.020280,The room's occupants were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain.,-88.60867309570312,21
brown.020281,If only the latter were true.,-23.436668395996094,7
brown.020282,He walked rapidly along the buildings scanning their facades: one was a club -- that was out.,-100.16143035888672,20
brown.020283,Two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted.,-72.27108001708984,13
brown.020284,"That left three, possibly four, one looking much like the next.",-67.11906433105469,14
brown.020285,He climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule.,-53.58734130859375,17
brown.020286,He quickly closed it again.,-27.935474395751953,6
brown.020287,That made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance.,-88.4622802734375,20
brown.020288,He went on to the next building and found what he expected -- the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule.,-110.32133483886719,26
brown.020289,On one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes.,-57.00669860839844,14
brown.020290,The names on the mailboxes meant nothing to him.,-38.029327392578125,11
brown.020291,This was senseless -- he had no idea what to look for.,-50.66166687011719,13
brown.020292,He peered in the boxes themselves.,-41.830326080322266,8
brown.020293,"All were empty except one, and that one was jammed with letters and magazines.",-63.6548957824707,16
brown.020294,"The occupants of Apartment Number 3 were probably away for a few days, and not likely to return on a Friday.",-82.42723846435547,24
brown.020295,Had Muller made the same deduction??,-52.55199432373047,7
brown.020296,Muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes.,-57.27104949951172,12
brown.020297,He opened the inner door.,-27.8934383392334,6
brown.020298,"The cooking odors were stronger -- all over the city, at this hour, housewives would be fussing over stoves.",-108.30095672607422,26
brown.020299,Now he was certain: the lock had not yielded to Muller's collection of keys.,-84.09810638427734,17
brown.020300,Fresh scars showed that the door had been prized open.,-65.43215942382812,11
brown.020301,"It had been shut again, but the lock was broken.",-46.803749084472656,12
brown.020302,He noted with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch.,-67.56620025634766,15
brown.020303,What was he to do now??,-35.76700973510742,7
brown.020304,He had thought no further than finding Muller.,-51.22761535644531,9
brown.020305,He could not break in on an armed man.,-47.54914093017578,10
brown.020306,He would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop.,-60.165733337402344,15
brown.020307,His thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door.,-53.925323486328125,19
brown.020308,He stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill.,-66.99342346191406,17
brown.020309,Hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled for the switch: evil flourishes in the dark.,-93.71011352539062,23
brown.020310,The room was bathed in light at the instant Muller's second shot came.,-68.53753662109375,16
brown.020311,His face wore a look of outrage.,-31.650409698486328,8
brown.020312,A shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain.,-66.7821044921875,13
brown.020313,"A following volley of shots shattered glass, ripped the ceiling, and sent him lurching heavily from the table.",-98.1329116821289,23
brown.020314,He was dead before his body made contact with the floor.,-35.24104690551758,12
brown.020315,"Hoag stumbled back into the hall, leaned against the wall, and started to retch.",-66.87641906738281,19
brown.020316,"It was more a matter of tact, and also it was none of Killpath's goddam business.",-92.69996643066406,21
brown.020317,He stared at the clerk who sat at a scarred and ancient fumed-oak desk stuffing envelopes.,-106.1655044555664,22
brown.020318,The clerk wagged his head toward the captain's office.,-50.934329986572266,12
