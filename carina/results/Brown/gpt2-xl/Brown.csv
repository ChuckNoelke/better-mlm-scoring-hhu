brown.013829,This is clearly a deficiency in T.,-38.40240478515625,8
brown.013830,Thus T is not diagonalizable.,-44.29711151123047,7
brown.013831,One sees that this happens because the null space of Af has dimension 1 only.,-94.98439025878906,16
brown.013832,This will be more or less our general method for the second problem.,-58.051082611083984,14

brown.013841,"Since Af and P divides Af for Af, we have Af.",-82.05772399902344,13

brown.013845,It is certainly clear that the subspaces Af are invariant under T.,-78.50529479980469,16

brown.013965,"There are two types of such intersections, depending essentially on whether the curves cross at the point of intersection.",-71.36353302001953,21
brown.013966,Any other point of intersection between C and Af will be called a tangent point.,-79.79056549072266,17
brown.013967,This terminology will also be applied to the corresponding points in the Aj.,-71.87203216552734,14
brown.013968,We can now prove several lemmas.,-40.86528015136719,9
brown.013969,We first show that the function is single-valued in some neighborhood.,-61.785343170166016,14
brown.013970,In the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are Af.,-71.95332336425781,14
brown.013971,We know that in the C-plane both C and Af are analytic.,-77.253173828125,15
brown.013972,"Near Q, both curves can be represented by analytic functions of U.",-75.72322845458984,14
brown.013973,"In a neighborhood of Q the difference between these functions is also a single-valued, analytic function of U.",-114.75704956054688,22
brown.013974,"Now, to find Af, one needs the intersection of C and Af near Q.",-93.27531433105469,17
brown.013975,The arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve.,-56.247589111328125,11
brown.013976,"Therefore, Af is single-valued near Q.",-73.1941146850586,10
brown.013977,"It is also seen that Af, since the change from Af to Af is accomplished by a continuous translation.",-100.81078338623047,21
brown.013978,"Thus Af is also continuous at Af, and in a neighborhood of Af which does not contain a tangent point.",-114.09886169433594,23
brown.013979,We turn now to the set of tangent points on the graph.,-52.5707893371582,14
brown.013980,This set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals.,-63.13900375366211,11
brown.013981,This prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points.,-66.68992614746094,14
brown.013982,A tangent point Q in the C-plane occurs when C and Af are tangent to one another.,-98.809326171875,22
brown.013983,In the second category the function Af has no values defined in a neighborhood Af.,-97.42620086669922,16
brown.013984,In the third category the function is double-valued in this interval.,-68.31683349609375,14
brown.013985,The same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of Af.,-69.16492462158203,14
brown.013986,"Again, the analyticity of the two curves guarantees that such intervals exist.",-75.40802764892578,16
brown.013987,With the above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of F.,-61.47408676147461,16
brown.013988,The graph of f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval Aj.,-95.11470031738281,17
brown.013989,Then every component of the graph of F must be defined over a bounded sub-interval.,-85.84335327148438,19
brown.013990,Suppose Af is defined in the sub-interval Af.,-71.42525482177734,13
brown.013991,Now Af and Af must both be tangent points on the T component in the f-plane.,-105.05748748779297,20
brown.013992,Otherwise by Lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these points.,-85.2752456665039,13
brown.013993,Thus the multiplicity of Af for a given T must be an even number.,-72.67462921142578,16
brown.013994,This is true of all components which have such a bounded support.,-61.79401397705078,13
brown.013995,"There must be an odd number of such components, which will be called complete components.",-69.42720031738281,17
brown.013996,We again consider a fixed point P at Af and a variable point Q at Af on C.,-97.98194885253906,19
brown.013997,"We have Af, plus tangent points.",-62.46641159057617,9
brown.013998,These s-values are just the ordinary values of Af.,-67.58863830566406,12
brown.013999,The functions F and B have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument T.,-76.1231689453125,16
brown.014000,No generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible.,-84.69853973388672,20
brown.014001,The line Af is the image of L.,-59.914527893066406,9
brown.014002,"Clearly, the transformation is involutorial.",-56.336055755615234,8
brown.014003,"We observe first that no line, l, can meet its image except at one of its intersections with Q.",-102.22280883789062,22
brown.014004,"For if it did, the plane of L and l' would contain two generators of Af, which is impossible.",-119.44873046875,23
brown.014005,Hence the totality of singular lines is the T order complex of lines which meet Aj.,-119.26729583740234,18
brown.014006,"There are various sets of exceptional lines, or lines whose images are not unique.",-74.64464569091797,16
brown.014007,Thus pencils of tangents to Q are transformed into pencils of tangents.,-84.2933349609375,17
brown.014008,"In particular, tangents to C are transformed into tangents to C'.",-66.75643157958984,15
brown.014009,The congruence of its secants is therefore of order Af and class Af.,-101.95365905761719,17
brown.014010,"In other words, these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all.",-70.3173828125,15
brown.014011,"Hence its image, C', meets any line of Af in Af points.",-118.00761413574219,16
brown.014012,"Moreover, C' obviously meets any line Af in a single point.",-98.85167694091797,14
brown.014013,Hence C' is a Af curve on Q.,-78.03508758544922,11
brown.014014,We now shall show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described.,-84.90886688232422,21
brown.014015,"To see this, consider a general pencil of lines containing a general secant of Aj.",-110.94867706298828,18
brown.014016,"From the preceding remarks, it is clear that such a bundle is transformed into itself in an involutorial fashion.",-106.01506805419922,22
brown.014017,"In each case, lines of the bundles are transformed by involutions within the pencils they determine with the multiple secant.",-140.26748657226562,25
brown.014018,"The multiple secants, of course, are exceptional and in each case are transformed into cones of order Af.",-118.08309173583984,22
brown.014019,Observations similar to these can be made at each point of Aj.,-69.8603515625,15
brown.014020,"Moreover, if Af, no two of the multiple secants can intersect.",-91.74990844726562,15
brown.014021,"Now consider an arbitrary line, l, meeting Q in two points, Af and Af.",-89.16434478759766,18
brown.014022,These societies can expect to face difficult times.,-43.98200988769531,9

brown.014028,In these rapidly changing societies there is also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goals.,-75.16964721679688,20
brown.014029,Such is the mystique of planning that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon its announcement.,-85.5140151977539,22

brown.014509,Welmers has suggested one explanation.,-48.57628631591797,8
brown.014510,Tone languages use for linguistic contrasts speech parameters which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use.,-111.35077667236328,20
brown.014511,This may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable.,-68.09339141845703,19
brown.014512,The problem is to disentangle the linguistic features of pitch from the co-occurring nonlinguistic features.,-74.76982116699219,24

brown.014515,A second explanation is suggested by the material described in Rowlands' paper.,-60.227481842041016,15
brown.014516,Tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed.,-56.54462432861328,13

brown.014518,"For example, duration sometimes figures in both the vowel system and the intonation.",-74.87126159667969,17

brown.014527,"Consonantal systems are not merely larger, they are multidimensional.",-63.118343353271484,16
brown.014528,Morphophonemic rules may be thought of as joining certain points in the system.,-83.83820343017578,17
brown.014529,"The possibilities in the consonantal system are very numerous, and only a small portion of them are actually used.",-68.12606811523438,23

brown.014532,The statement of the system is a different matter.,-40.55525207519531,10

brown.020221,"You wouldn't pull my leg, old man??",-52.09492874145508,10
brown.020222,He peered closely at Hoag in the gathering darkness.,-54.59878921508789,12
brown.020223,He stared at Hoag drunkenly.,-44.55326461791992,8
brown.020224,Griffith was trying to clear his head of the champagne fuzz that encased it.,-81.11834716796875,18
brown.020225,"Look, old man, you can't go up.",-39.09359359741211,11

brown.020227,Hoag grabbed him by the shoulders.,-40.89536666870117,8
brown.020228,He bit out the words.,-29.793495178222656,6
brown.020229,He turned and fled into the house and made his way up the marble stairs without once looking back.,-62.823551177978516,20
brown.020230,"On the second landing he paused to look for Docherty, didn't see him, and accepted a glass of champagne.",-96.0973129272461,24
brown.020231,"The way Hoag was, no telling what he might say or do.",-59.51531982421875,15
brown.020232,He finished his champagne and climbed uncertainly to the next landing.,-66.50714111328125,13
brown.020233,At the top a uniformed officer blocked further progress.,-52.475624084472656,11
brown.020234,He spotted Docherty coming out of a room at the far end of the corridor and called to him.,-70.71141052246094,21
brown.020235,"Docherty said,"" It's okay, Bonfiglio, let him by"".",-85.66557312011719,16

brown.020237,"Griffith said,"" Hoag told me to tell you"" -- he waited until they were close.",-104.50067901611328,21
brown.020238,"It was hideously embarrassing --"" not to let the prime minister be alone with Mahzeer"".",-114.52275085449219,20
brown.020239,Griffith looked half-crocked to the captain.,-61.18824005126953,13
brown.020240,It would be just like him.,-24.146217346191406,7
brown.020241,Docherty went taut: was it possible??,-70.34396362304688,10
brown.020242,Could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister feared??,-88.3946304321289,15
brown.020243,The prime minister knew who his enemy was here.,-43.94584274291992,10
brown.020244,He wasn't going to allow himself to be led meekly to the slaughter.,-48.0502815246582,17
brown.020245,One more muddleheaded play like that one and they'd be leading him away.,-88.51016235351562,17
brown.020246,"Still, this had to be checked out.",-36.73069763183594,9
brown.020247,"Troubled, he continued along the corridor, poking his head into the next office for a careful look around.",-79.4511947631836,23
brown.020248,But Hoag had not stayed on the front steps when Griffith disappeared into the building.,-87.11384582519531,17
brown.020249,He would have to do something on his own.,-31.406097412109375,10
brown.020250,The door opened and three men and a woman in a sari swept past him and down the stairs.,-67.86273956298828,21
brown.020251,In the lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their wraps.,-75.04234313964844,16
brown.020252,These were the early departures.,-32.00674819946289,6
brown.020253,In half an hour the reception would be over.,-38.74517822265625,10
brown.020254,Hoag descended the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building.,-60.67265701293945,16
brown.020255,Wide windows with many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories.,-77.89774322509766,15
brown.020256,On the second floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests.,-57.13127899169922,14
brown.020257,The scene looked like a Christmas card.,-31.786598205566406,8
brown.020258,On the third floor one of the two windows was lighted.,-46.51655578613281,13
brown.020259,"It was framed in maroon drapes, and no faces were visible.",-57.64686965942383,16
brown.020260,This would be Mahzeer's office.,-47.107666015625,9
brown.020261,"He and the prime minister would be back from the window, seated at Mahzeer's desk.",-92.67332458496094,20
brown.020262,They would be going over papers Mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting.,-110.7499771118164,19
brown.020263,"In a minute, or five minutes, the business would be done.",-50.470298767089844,14
brown.020264,"Mahzeer would stand up, the prime minister would follow.",-62.89152145385742,13
brown.020265,The single shot would come.,-35.645606994628906,6
brown.020266,Hoag would carry its sound to his grave.,-61.58924865722656,10
brown.020267,"Mahzeer, of course, would be desolate.",-54.8097038269043,11
brown.020268,Where was Muller waiting with the rifle??,-54.689334869384766,8
brown.020269,Narrow four-story buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf.,-81.73685455322266,20
brown.020270,Most of them could be eliminated.,-28.10011863708496,7
brown.020271,Muller's would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly opposite.,-76.71519470214844,17
brown.020272,The legation was generously set back from the building line.,-62.233177185058594,12
brown.020273,If the angle of fire were too great the jutting buildings on either side would interfere.,-79.77356719970703,19
brown.020274,Would the shot come from a roof??,-50.20568084716797,8
brown.020275,He ran his eye along the roof copings.,-56.33951187133789,10
brown.020276,Almost at once a figure bulked up.,-49.41545867919922,9
brown.020277,But dully glinting on the dark form were the buttons and badge of a policeman.,-87.2571792602539,19
brown.020278,"Hoag crossed the narrow street, squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk.",-67.23051452636719,16
brown.020279,"From this side he could see farther into the legation's third-story window, but he saw no faces.",-93.2413558959961,23
brown.020280,The room's occupants were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain.,-88.6086654663086,21
brown.020281,If only the latter were true.,-23.436668395996094,7
brown.020282,He walked rapidly along the buildings scanning their facades: one was a club -- that was out.,-100.16143798828125,20
brown.020283,Two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted.,-72.27106475830078,13
brown.020284,"That left three, possibly four, one looking much like the next.",-67.11906433105469,14
brown.020285,He climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule.,-53.587337493896484,17
brown.020286,He quickly closed it again.,-27.935474395751953,6
brown.020287,That made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance.,-88.4622802734375,20
brown.020288,He went on to the next building and found what he expected -- the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule.,-110.32132720947266,26
brown.020289,On one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes.,-57.00669479370117,14
brown.020290,The names on the mailboxes meant nothing to him.,-38.02933120727539,11
brown.020291,This was senseless -- he had no idea what to look for.,-50.66166687011719,13
brown.020292,He peered in the boxes themselves.,-41.830318450927734,8
brown.020293,"All were empty except one, and that one was jammed with letters and magazines.",-63.6548957824707,16
brown.020294,"The occupants of Apartment Number 3 were probably away for a few days, and not likely to return on a Friday.",-82.42724609375,24
brown.020295,Had Muller made the same deduction??,-52.55198287963867,7
brown.020296,Muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes.,-57.27105712890625,12
brown.020297,He opened the inner door.,-27.893436431884766,6
brown.020298,"The cooking odors were stronger -- all over the city, at this hour, housewives would be fussing over stoves.",-108.30096435546875,26
brown.020299,Now he was certain: the lock had not yielded to Muller's collection of keys.,-84.09811401367188,17
brown.020300,Fresh scars showed that the door had been prized open.,-65.4321517944336,11
brown.020301,"It had been shut again, but the lock was broken.",-46.80373764038086,12
brown.020302,He noted with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch.,-67.56619262695312,15
brown.020303,What was he to do now??,-35.76701354980469,7
brown.020304,He had thought no further than finding Muller.,-51.22761535644531,9
brown.020305,He could not break in on an armed man.,-47.549129486083984,10
brown.020306,He would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop.,-60.165748596191406,15
brown.020307,His thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door.,-53.92533493041992,19
brown.020308,He stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill.,-66.993408203125,17
brown.020309,Hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled for the switch: evil flourishes in the dark.,-93.7101058959961,23
brown.020310,The room was bathed in light at the instant Muller's second shot came.,-68.53753662109375,16
brown.020311,His face wore a look of outrage.,-31.650405883789062,8
brown.020312,A shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain.,-66.7821044921875,13
brown.020313,"A following volley of shots shattered glass, ripped the ceiling, and sent him lurching heavily from the table.",-98.13289642333984,23
brown.020314,He was dead before his body made contact with the floor.,-35.24104309082031,12
brown.020315,"Hoag stumbled back into the hall, leaned against the wall, and started to retch.",-66.87641906738281,19
