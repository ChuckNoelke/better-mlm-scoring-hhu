brown.013966,Any other point of intersection between C and Af will be called a tangent point.,-75.27275085449219,17
brown.013967,This terminology will also be applied to the corresponding points in the Aj.,-70.43144226074219,14
brown.013968,We can now prove several lemmas.,-45.40138244628906,9
brown.013969,We first show that the function is single-valued in some neighborhood.,-64.25736999511719,14
brown.013970,In the f-plane the coordinates of the corresponding point are Af.,-76.6241226196289,14
brown.013971,We know that in the C-plane both C and Af are analytic.,-77.37889099121094,15
brown.013972,"Near Q, both curves can be represented by analytic functions of U.",-80.27122497558594,14
brown.013973,"In a neighborhood of Q the difference between these functions is also a single-valued, analytic function of U.",-111.87593078613281,22
brown.013974,"Now, to find Af, one needs the intersection of C and Af near Q.",-96.83888244628906,17
brown.013975,The arc is itself a segment of an analytic curve.,-60.25946807861328,11
brown.013976,"Therefore, Af is single-valued near Q.",-69.38426208496094,10
brown.013977,"It is also seen that Af, since the change from Af to Af is accomplished by a continuous translation.",-101.56645202636719,21
brown.013978,"Thus Af is also continuous at Af, and in a neighborhood of Af which does not contain a tangent point.",-124.68463134765625,23
brown.013979,We turn now to the set of tangent points on the graph.,-54.56903839111328,14
brown.013980,This set must consist of isolated points and closed intervals.,-62.1809196472168,11
brown.013981,This prevents the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolated tangent points.,-61.01704788208008,14
brown.013982,A tangent point Q in the C-plane occurs when C and Af are tangent to one another.,-103.99093627929688,22
brown.013983,In the second category the function Af has no values defined in a neighborhood Af.,-98.39556884765625,16
brown.013984,In the third category the function is double-valued in this interval.,-67.52460479736328,14
brown.013985,The same remarks apply to an interval on the other side of Af.,-71.8296890258789,14
brown.013986,"Again, the analyticity of the two curves guarantees that such intervals exist.",-75.4490966796875,16
brown.013987,With the above results we can make the following remarks about the graph of F.,-66.96755981445312,16
brown.013988,The graph of f has at least one component whose support is the entire interval Aj.,-96.12574768066406,17
brown.013989,Then every component of the graph of F must be defined over a bounded sub-interval.,-94.01001739501953,19
brown.013990,Suppose Af is defined in the sub-interval Af.,-76.72595977783203,13
brown.013991,Now Af and Af must both be tangent points on the T component in the f-plane.,-109.1273193359375,20
brown.013992,Otherwise by Lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these points.,-80.21936798095703,13
brown.013993,Thus the multiplicity of Af for a given T must be an even number.,-76.70808410644531,16
brown.013994,This is true of all components which have such a bounded support.,-61.84598159790039,13
brown.013995,"There must be an odd number of such components, which will be called complete components.",-70.25102233886719,17
brown.013996,We again consider a fixed point P at Af and a variable point Q at Af on C.,-94.31947326660156,19
brown.013997,"We have Af, plus tangent points.",-64.22969055175781,9
brown.013998,These s-values are just the ordinary values of Af.,-64.44091796875,12
brown.013999,The functions F and B have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument T.,-78.97911071777344,16
brown.014000,No generalization of these results to spaces of more than three dimensions has so far been found possible.,-78.57469177246094,20
brown.014001,The line Af is the image of L.,-56.92634963989258,9
brown.014002,"Clearly, the transformation is involutorial.",-56.2078971862793,8
brown.014003,"We observe first that no line, l, can meet its image except at one of its intersections with Q.",-99.50772094726562,22
brown.014004,"For if it did, the plane of L and l' would contain two generators of Af, which is impossible.",-121.18963623046875,23
brown.014005,Hence the totality of singular lines is the T order complex of lines which meet Aj.,-122.027587890625,18
brown.014006,"There are various sets of exceptional lines, or lines whose images are not unique.",-72.73384094238281,16
brown.014007,Thus pencils of tangents to Q are transformed into pencils of tangents.,-76.1883544921875,17
brown.014008,"In particular, tangents to C are transformed into tangents to C'.",-61.948368072509766,15
brown.014009,The congruence of its secants is therefore of order Af and class Af.,-102.73855590820312,17
brown.014010,"In other words, these curves have only fixed intersections common to them all.",-70.52781677246094,15
brown.014011,"Hence its image, C', meets any line of Af in Af points.",-118.25460815429688,16
brown.014012,"Moreover, C' obviously meets any line Af in a single point.",-102.46370697021484,14
brown.014013,Hence C' is a Af curve on Q.,-85.63253784179688,11
brown.014014,We now shall show that any involution with these characteristics is necessarily of the type we have just described.,-86.43144226074219,21
brown.014015,"To see this, consider a general pencil of lines containing a general secant of Aj.",-111.39724731445312,18
brown.014016,"From the preceding remarks, it is clear that such a bundle is transformed into itself in an involutorial fashion.",-109.48736572265625,22
brown.014017,"In each case, lines of the bundles are transformed by involutions within the pencils they determine with the multiple secant.",-141.10191345214844,25
brown.014018,"The multiple secants, of course, are exceptional and in each case are transformed into cones of order Af.",-118.43995666503906,22
brown.014019,Observations similar to these can be made at each point of Aj.,-66.75540924072266,15
brown.014020,"Moreover, if Af, no two of the multiple secants can intersect.",-94.45384216308594,15
brown.014021,"Now consider an arbitrary line, l, meeting Q in two points, Af and Af.",-99.94392395019531,18

brown.014515,A second explanation is suggested by the material described in Rowlands' paper.,-61.53874969482422,15
brown.014516,Tone and intonation often become seriously intermeshed.,-60.25824737548828,13

brown.014527,"Consonantal systems are not merely larger, they are multidimensional.",-59.718563079833984,16

brown.015558,The failure to keep these two usages distinct presents hazards to the reader.,-67.56364440917969,15

brown.019187,For just an instant he thought of appealing to them for help.,-53.41803741455078,13
brown.019188,Perhaps they had a car or truck and would drive him into town.,-60.62687301635742,14
brown.019189,Then he realized the utter futility of the idea.,-37.387786865234375,11

brown.019230,That way was barred on both sides of the road by a high barbed-wire fence.,-72.87017059326172,19
brown.019231,At least he could climb up on the fence when his tormenters roared by again.,-77.27531433105469,17

brown.020242,Could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister feared??,-86.78900909423828,15
brown.020243,The prime minister knew who his enemy was here.,-42.1002197265625,10

brown.020247,"Troubled, he continued along the corridor, poking his head into the next office for a careful look around.",-84.19110107421875,23
brown.020248,But Hoag had not stayed on the front steps when Griffith disappeared into the building.,-86.5062484741211,17
brown.020249,He would have to do something on his own.,-30.822052001953125,10
brown.020250,The door opened and three men and a woman in a sari swept past him and down the stairs.,-69.83174896240234,21
brown.020251,In the lighted interior he saw other men and women struggling into their wraps.,-77.38905334472656,16
brown.020252,These were the early departures.,-33.45818328857422,6
brown.020253,In half an hour the reception would be over.,-38.11298370361328,10
brown.020254,Hoag descended the stone steps to the street and looked up at the building.,-64.84789276123047,16
brown.020255,Wide windows with many small leaded panes swept across the upper stories.,-79.89443969726562,15
brown.020256,On the second floor he saw the animated faces of the party guests.,-57.59016799926758,14
brown.020257,The scene looked like a Christmas card.,-30.964332580566406,8
brown.020258,On the third floor one of the two windows was lighted.,-48.73167419433594,13
brown.020259,"It was framed in maroon drapes, and no faces were visible.",-58.239559173583984,16
brown.020260,This would be Mahzeer's office.,-47.491127014160156,9
brown.020261,"He and the prime minister would be back from the window, seated at Mahzeer's desk.",-96.30126953125,20
brown.020262,They would be going over papers Mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting.,-112.52771759033203,19
brown.020263,"In a minute, or five minutes, the business would be done.",-48.45024108886719,14

brown.020268,Where was Muller waiting with the rifle??,-56.35969543457031,8
brown.020269,Narrow four-story buildings ran the length of the block like books tightly packed on a shelf.,-80.04325103759766,20
brown.020270,Most of them could be eliminated.,-28.98440170288086,7
brown.020271,Muller's would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly opposite.,-72.41970825195312,17
brown.020272,The legation was generously set back from the building line.,-61.10047149658203,12
brown.020273,If the angle of fire were too great the jutting buildings on either side would interfere.,-83.80155181884766,19
brown.020274,Would the shot come from a roof??,-47.476226806640625,8
brown.020275,He ran his eye along the roof copings.,-61.215370178222656,10
brown.020276,Almost at once a figure bulked up.,-45.94669723510742,9
brown.020277,But dully glinting on the dark form were the buttons and badge of a policeman.,-90.78666687011719,19
brown.020278,"Hoag crossed the narrow street, squeezing between parked cars to reach the sidewalk.",-71.31822967529297,16
brown.020279,"From this side he could see farther into the legation's third-story window, but he saw no faces.",-95.56893157958984,23
brown.020280,The room's occupants were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain.,-89.19100952148438,21
brown.020281,If only the latter were true.,-23.558982849121094,7
brown.020282,He walked rapidly along the buildings scanning their facades: one was a club -- that was out.,-101.29023742675781,20
brown.020283,Two others he ruled out because all their windows were lighted.,-72.73686981201172,13
brown.020284,"That left three, possibly four, one looking much like the next.",-69.86257934570312,14
brown.020285,He climbed the steps of the first and opened the door to the vestibule.,-53.84690475463867,17
brown.020286,He quickly closed it again.,-26.429210662841797,6
brown.020287,That made it doubtful as the hiding place of a man whose plans had to be made in advance.,-83.7506332397461,20
brown.020288,He went on to the next building and found what he expected -- the mingled cooking aromas of a public vestibule.,-110.27837371826172,26
brown.020289,On one wall was the brass front of a row of mailboxes.,-61.58557891845703,14
brown.020290,The names on the mailboxes meant nothing to him.,-40.184852600097656,11
brown.020291,This was senseless -- he had no idea what to look for.,-50.63896560668945,13
brown.020292,He peered in the boxes themselves.,-42.64290237426758,8
brown.020293,"All were empty except one, and that one was jammed with letters and magazines.",-63.0731315612793,16
brown.020294,"The occupants of Apartment Number 3 were probably away for a few days, and not likely to return on a Friday.",-86.2081527709961,24
brown.020295,Had Muller made the same deduction??,-53.00399398803711,7
brown.020296,Muller was attracted to the lore of mailboxes.,-56.01634216308594,12
brown.020297,He opened the inner door.,-26.57098388671875,6
brown.020298,"The cooking odors were stronger -- all over the city, at this hour, housewives would be fussing over stoves.",-108.84113311767578,26
brown.020299,Now he was certain: the lock had not yielded to Muller's collection of keys.,-86.32882690429688,17
brown.020300,Fresh scars showed that the door had been prized open.,-68.83997344970703,11
brown.020301,"It had been shut again, but the lock was broken.",-44.99419403076172,12
brown.020302,He noted with a thrill of fear that the door moved under his touch.,-69.34059143066406,15
brown.020303,What was he to do now??,-32.810218811035156,7
brown.020304,He had thought no further than finding Muller.,-52.05803680419922,9
brown.020305,He could not break in on an armed man.,-46.917930603027344,10
brown.020306,He would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop.,-58.753726959228516,15
brown.020307,His thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door.,-65.64591979980469,19
brown.020308,He stood with his feet apart on a kitchen table he had dragged to the sill.,-69.2418441772461,17
brown.020309,Hoag stretched his left hand to the wall and fumbled for the switch: evil flourishes in the dark.,-103.80101013183594,23
brown.020310,The room was bathed in light at the instant Muller's second shot came.,-67.38507843017578,16
brown.020311,His face wore a look of outrage.,-31.472909927368164,8
brown.020312,A shot caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain.,-62.922542572021484,13
brown.020313,"A following volley of shots shattered glass, ripped the ceiling, and sent him lurching heavily from the table.",-97.03575134277344,23
