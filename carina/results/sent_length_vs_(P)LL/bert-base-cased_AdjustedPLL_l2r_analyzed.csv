2961-960-0002,In the supposed depths of this dialogue the neo platonists found hidden meanings and connections with the jewish and christian scriptures and out of them they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of plato.,-157.01290225982666,157.01290225982666,51,36,1.4166666666666667,2

2961-960-0006,The fancies of the neo platonists are only interesting to us because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own day.,-139.2854585647583,139.2854585647583,49,40,1.225,1

2961-960-0010,But he has not as yet defined this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in ranking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul.,-118.25097846984865,118.25097846984865,53,48,1.1041666666666667,0
2961-960-0011,With heracleitus he acknowledges the perpetual flux like anaxagoras he asserts the predominance of mind although admitting an element of necessity which reason is incapable of subduing like the pythagoreans he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in number.,-241.8383955955505,241.8383955955505,63,42,1.5,2

2961-961-0022,Then now let me explain to you the order of our entertainment first timaeus who is a natural philosopher will speak of the origin of the world going down to the creation of man and then i shall receive the men whom he has created and some of whom will have been educated by you and introduce them to you as the lost athenian citizens of whom the egyptian record spoke.,-203.9376392364502,203.9376392364502,80,71,1.1267605633802817,0
3570-5694-0000,But already at a point in economic evolution far antedating the emergence of the lady specialised consumption of goods as an evidence of pecuniary strength had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system.,-165.7479772567749,165.7479772567749,45,37,1.2162162162162162,0
3570-5694-0001,The utility of consumption as an evidence of wealth is to be classed as a derivative growth.,-61.68509817123413,61.68509817123413,21,17,1.2352941176470589,1

3570-5694-0003,With a further advance in culture this tabu may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained whether it be a tabu or a larger conventionality the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily.,-172.20492696762085,172.20492696762085,59,53,1.1132075471698113,0

3570-5694-0006,Drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific as being a mark at the second remove of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence.,-161.28853368759155,161.28853368759155,55,41,1.3414634146341464,2

3570-5694-0010,The objection of course presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial.,-90.17026615142822,90.17026615142822,45,37,1.2162162162162162,0

3570-5694-0013,This differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility.,-64.6497597694397,64.6497597694397,23,15,1.5333333333333334,3
3570-5694-0014,Many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time lesser men of substance in their own right so that some of them are scarcely at all others only partially to be rated as vicarious consumers.,-111.13718557357788,111.13718557357788,42,38,1.105263157894737,0
3570-5694-0015,So many of them however as make up the retainer and hangers on of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification.,-117.71948766708374,117.71948766708374,31,24,1.2916666666666667,1
3570-5694-0016,Many of these again and also many of the other aristocracy of less degree have in turn attached to their persons a more or less comprehensive group of vicarious consumer in the persons of their wives and children their servants retainers et cetera.,-170.1220030784607,170.1220030784607,50,43,1.1627906976744187,0
3570-5694-0017,The wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude real or ostensible.,-91.4040355682373,91.4040355682373,35,26,1.3461538461538463,2

3570-5694-0020,So those offices which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble such as government fighting hunting the care of arms and accoutrements and the like in short those which may be classed as ostensibly predatory employments.,-198.73845863342285,198.73845863342285,50,41,1.2195121951219512,1
3570-5694-0021,Whenever as in these cases the menial service in question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting it easily acquires a reflected honorific character.,-131.47200345993042,131.47200345993042,37,30,1.2333333333333334,1

3570-5695-0001,The dependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife or the chief wife and as would be expected in the later development of the institution when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarily performed gradually narrows the wife remains the last.,-148.05674839019775,148.05674839019775,53,47,1.127659574468085,0

5105-28240-0023,A slight diminution in the excessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alteration in the earth's orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide.,-95.7747926712036,95.7747926712036,61,52,1.1730769230769231,0

8230-279154-0025,We might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy.,-159.13501024246216,159.13501024246216,62,56,1.1071428571428572,0

8230-279154-0038,We are of course in fact able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word.,-102.37349891662598,102.37349891662598,58,55,1.0545454545454545,0
